- Linked lists are comprised of nodes that store an arbitrary value (usually a string or number)

- Different types of linked list:
    - Singly Linked List:  
      Has only one pointer that points to the next node in the list.
    - Doubly Linked List:  
      Has 2 pointers, one points to the previous node and the other points to the next node in the list.
      
- You only need a value in order to initialize a node.

- How to create a linked list in Python:
    ```
    class LinkedListNode:
        # Initializes the class with just a value
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.next = None
            self.value = value
        
        # Makes it more readable for debugging. 
        # Will print the return statement.
        def __repr__(self):
            return f'Node: {self.value}'
  
    # Create a few linked list nodes.
    a = LinkedListNode(1)
    b = LinkedListNode(2)
    c = LinkedListNode(3)
  
    # Assign the next pointer for the above linked list nodes
    a.next = b
    c.next = c
  
    # Create a function to traverse over the linked list.
    def traverse_linked_list(start_node):
        # The node you want to start at.
        curr = start_node
        
        # While we have a curr value, keep going.
        while curr != None:
            # Print the current 
            print(curr)
            # Assigns curr to next node.
            curr = curr.next
  
    # Use the above function to traverse the linked list starting at a
    traverse_linked_list(a)
    ```
  
- Runtime Complexity:
    - **Access** an element with an index = O(n)
        - Unlike arrays, linked lists donâ€™t have indexing, so you have to traverse the list.
    - **Searching** for an element = O(n)
        - You have to go through the linked list until you find the node.
    - Inserting a node = O(1)
        - Simply manipulate pointers to include the node.
    - Deleting a node = O(1)
        - Simply manipulate pointers to remove the node.
    
- Things to Know:
    - All problems deal with pointer-manipulation and traversing the list.
    
    - Most problems require you to use O(1) space.
    
    - Common patterns in solving these problems:
        - Dummy-head
          
        - Two-pointer
            - Use two pointers to manipulate references to nodes.

            - Also used to get certain information about list (e.g. detect cycle)
        

        - Manipulating node values
