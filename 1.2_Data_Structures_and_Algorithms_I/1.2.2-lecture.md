Linked lists are comprised of nodes that store an arbitrary value (usually a string, character or number)

### Different types of linked list:
  
![Both Linked Lists Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/both_linked-lists.jpg?token=APLSS6NZTZCS56N2ZMT4Z7TAM442Y)
- **Singly Linked List:**  
  Has `only one pointer` that points to the `next node` in the list.
  ![Singly Linked List Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/Singly_Linked_List_Example.png?token=APLSS6PV6NT52UCGLXLDATDAM43WI)

- **Doubly Linked List:**  
  Has `2 pointers`, one points to the `previous node` and the other points to the `next node` in the list.
    ![Doubly Linked List Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/doubly_linked_list.jpg?token=APLSS6J4TRV2N2OPORTEHLDAM446M)
      
- You only need a value in order to initialize a node.

### How to create a linked list in Python:
```
class LinkedListNode:
    # Initializes the class with just a value
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.next = None
        self.value = value
    
    # Makes it more readable for debugging. 
    # Will print the return statement.
    def __repr__(self):
        return f'Node: {self.value}'

# Create a few linked list nodes.
a = LinkedListNode(1)
b = LinkedListNode(2)
c = LinkedListNode(3)

# Assign the next pointer for the above linked list nodes
a.next = b
c.next = c

# Create a function to traverse over the linked list.
def traverse_linked_list(start_node):
    # The node you want to start at.
    curr = start_node
    
    # While we have a curr value, keep going.
    while curr != None:
        # Print the current 
        print(curr)
        # Assigns curr to next node.
        curr = curr.next

# Use the above function to traverse the linked list starting at a
traverse_linked_list(a)
```
  
### Runtime Complexity:
- **Access** an element with an index = `O(n)`
    - Unlike arrays, linked lists donâ€™t have indexing, so you have to traverse the list.
- **Searching** for an element = `O(n)`
    - You have to go through the linked list until you find the node.
- **Inserting** a node = `O(1)`
    - Simply manipulate pointers to include the node.
- **Deleting** a node = `O(1)`
    - Simply manipulate pointers to remove the node.
   
### Things to Know:
- All problems deal with pointer-manipulation and traversing the list.

- Most problems require you to use `O(1)` space.

- Common patterns in solving these problems:
    - Dummy-head Node
    
        - A node that always points to the beginning of the list or has a NULL pointer field if the list is empty.
        - This node does not contain any data included in the list.
        - This node is **permanent** and always points to the first node in the list.
        - Using a *dummy-head* node avoids the special case problems involved when inserting and/or deleting nodes.

        ![Dummy Head Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/Dummy_Head_Node.jpg?token=APLSS6NBSJ6KSY46MSQOTYLAM45UM)

    - Two-pointer:

        - Use two pointers to manipulate references to nodes.

        - Also used to get certain information about list (e.g. detect cycle)  
        
            ![Two-Pointer Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/Two_pointer_Linked_list.jpg?token=APLSS6NRIOCOATBSRIZRGMLAM4ZIO)
            * In the above image `1` is one of the pointers and `2` is the other pointer. In this example, `1` is pointing to the `head node` of the linked list and `2` is pointing at the `tail node` at the starting point. As you traverse through this list, the pointer `1` will point to the `B node` next and pointer `2` would point to `None` next if both pointers are moving to the right along the linked list.

            ![Two Pointers Classification Examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/Two_pointer_Linked_list_example2.png?token=APLSS6MFVUYNDX2UP2QCDGTAM46LW)

    - Manipulating node values:

        - When you manipulate node values, all you are doing is reassigning it's value to a value from a neighboring node, whether it is the previous or the next node, in order to delete a value in a specified node, but are not actually removing that node. 
        
        - This method comes in handy when you are working with a singly linked list and are not given the values of the other nodes. You would do this through iteration or recursion.

### Coding Practice

#### [Delete Node in a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/)
**Description:**  
Write a function to **delete a node** in a *singly-linked* list. You will **not be given access to the head** of the list, instead you will be given **access to the node to be deleted directly**.

It is **guaranteed** that the node to be deleted is **not a tail node** in the list.

**Example 1:**

![Example 1 Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/Delete%20Node%20in%20a%20Linked%20List%20-%20Example%201.jpg?token=APLSS6OYGENXCGFDYDCPKTTAM5NAS)

- *Input:* `head = [4,5,1,9]`, `node = 5`

- *Output:* `[4,1,9]`

- *Explanation:*  
    You are given the second node with value `5`, the linked list should become `4 -> 1 -> 9` after calling your function.

**Example 2:**

![Example 2 Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/Delete%20Node%20in%20a%20Linked%20List%20-%20Example%202.jpg?token=APLSS6NWRJ6MHZ6LMND6EB3AM5NDC)

- *Input:* `head = [4,5,1,9]`, `node = 1`

- *Output:* `[4,5,9]`

- *Explanation:*  
    You are given the third node with value `1`, the linked list should become `4 -> 5 -> 9` after calling your function.

**Example 3:**

- *Input:* `head = [1,2,3,4]`, `node = 3`

- *Output:* `[1,2,4]`

**Example 4:**

- *Input:* `head = [0,1]`, `node = 0`

- *Output:* `[1]`

**Example 5:**

- *Input:* `head = [-3,5,-99]`, `node = -3`

- *Output:* `[5,-99]`
 

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
`-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
- The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail node**.

#### [Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

- *Input:* `head = [1,2]`

**Constraints:**

#### [Odd Even Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)

**Description:**  
Given the `head` of a `singly linked list`, group all the `nodes with odd indices` together followed by the `nodes with even indices`, and `return` the `reordered list`.

The **first node** is considered **odd**, and the **second node** is **even**, and so on.

**Note:**  
The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

**Example 1:**
