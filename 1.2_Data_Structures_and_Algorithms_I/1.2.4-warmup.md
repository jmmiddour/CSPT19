### Overview
### What is a logarithm?
Logarithms are a way of looking differently at exponentials. I know that this is a bit of a vague definition, so let's look at an example.

2<sup>5</sup>

What does the mathematical expression above *mean*? It's an abbreviation for the following expression:

`2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2`

What we are looking at above is two different ways to express an object that doubles in size with each iteration.

Another way to think about `2^5 = 32` is that `2` is the "growth rate" and `5` is the number of times you went through the growth (doubling). `32` is the final result.

Let's look at a few more expressions:

2<sup>5</sup> = 32

2<sup>0</sup> = 1

2<sup>-1</sup> = 1/2

Now, to begin looking at logarithms, let's rewrite the exponential expressions above in logarithmic form.

*log*<sub>2</sub>32 = 5

*log*<sub>2</sub>1 = 0

*log*<sub>2</sub> 1/2 = 1

Notice how we have essentially just moved around different pieces of the expression.

For our first expression,

2<sup>5</sup> = 32

`2` was the "growth rate", `5` was the "time" spent growing, and `32` was where we ended up. When we rewrite this logarithmically, we have

*log*<sub>2</sub>32 = 5

In this case, `2` still represents the "growth rate" and `32` still represents where we end up. The `5` also still represents the "time" spent growing.

So, the `difference` between `when` we would use a `logarithm` and when we use `exponentiation` depends on `what factors we know` ahead of time. If you `know the growth rate`, and you know `how long you are growing`, you can use `exponentiation` (`2^5`) to figure out where you end up (`32`). However, if you `know the growth rate` and `where you end up` but do not know the time spent growing, you can use a `logarithm` (`log_2 32`) to figure that out.

Logarithms have an *inverse* relationship with exponents, just like division and multiplication have an inverse relationship.

For example, if you know that you have one group of `5` items, and you want to identify the total you would have if you had `4` of those groups instead of just one, you could express that with `5 * 4 = 20`. However, if you knew that you had a total of `20` items and you wanted to know how many groups of `5` you could make out your total, you could express that with `20 \ 5 = 4`.

### Follow Along
### Why should I care? 
### What does this have to do with programming and interview preparation?

In computer science, you often ask questions like *"How many times must `n` be divided in half before we get to one?"* or *"How many times will we halve this collection before the collection has only one item?"* To answer these questions, you can use `logarithms`! `Halving` is like `doubling`, so we can say that `log_2 n` would give us the answer we're seeking.

You will see this come up when analyzing the `time complexity` of specific algorithms. `Any algorithm that doubles or halves a number or collection on each iteration of a loop is likely to have O(log n) time complexity`. You will see this come up specifically when we talk about `binary search` and its `time complexity`. You will also see this come up in specific `sorting algorithms` (like `merge sort`). In simple terms, `merge sort divides a collection in half` and `then merges the sorted halves`. The fact that `the algorithm repeatedly halves something` is `your clue` that it includes a `logarithm` in its `time complexity`. One last place you're likely to see `logarithms` come up is with a `perfect binary tree`. One property of these `binary trees` is that the `number of nodes doubles at each level`.

### Challenge
1. Write a *logarithmic expression* that is *identical* to this *exponential expression*: 2<sup>n</sup> = 64
    - *log*<sub>2</sub>64 = n

2. Write an *exponential expression* that is *identical* to this *logarithmic expression*: *log*<sub>2</sub>128 = n
    - 2<sup>n</sup> = 128

3. What keywords should you look out for that might alert you that logarithms are involved?
    - If the algorithm repeatedly halves something

### Overview
Imagine that I've chosen a random number from `1` to `20`. Then, you must guess the number. One approach would be to start picking at `1` and `increment` your guess `by 1` with `each guess`. If the computer randomly selected 20, then it would take you 20 guesses to get the correct answer. If the computer guessed 1, then you would have the right answer on your very first guess. On average, you will get the correct answer on the 10th or 11th guess.

If the collection we are searching through is `random and unsorted`, `linear search is the most efficient` way to search through it. Once we have a `sorted list`, then there are `more efficient approaches` to use.

### Follow Along
We want to write a simple program to conduct a `linear search` on a collection of data. Let's write a function that takes a list (`arr`) and an integer (`target`) as its input and `returns` the integer `idx` where the target is found. If the target does not exist in the `arr`, then the function should return `-1`.

```
def linear_search(arr, target):
    # loop through each item in the input array
    for idx in range(len(arr)):
    
        # check if the item at the current index is equal 
        #   to the target
        if arr[idx] == target:
            # return the current index as the match
            return idx

    # if we were able to loop through the entire array, 
    #   the target is not present
    return -1
```

### Overview
### What is recursion?
Recursion is a method to solve problems. It means `breaking down a problem into smaller and smaller sub-problems until the sub-problem is easy to solve`. `Recursive functions call themselves`. Often, recursive solutions are terse and elegant. Recursive solutions are `not always the most efficient`. However, they `can be an excellent starting point` that you can improve the efficiency of later on.

### A simple example
Let's say that I give you a list of numbers.

```
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

I ask you to write a function that returns the sum of all the numbers in the list.

With an iterative approach, you would need a `variable` to keep track of the sum, a `loop` that adds each item in the list to the sum, and to `return` the `sum` after the loop ends.

```
def sum_list(items):
    sum = 0
    for i in items:
        sum = sum + i
    return sum
```

This iterative function depends on the ability to `loop` through `each item` in the list. `Another way to iterate` through a collection is with `recursion`. It's a little harder to understand at first, but the `resulting code` is often `cleaner, simpler, and easier to understand`.

**How many numbers can you sum without having to rely on the loop construct?** The answer is `two`. How can we think of our problem as a collection of sums of only two numbers?

I'll put it another way. If you had the following, and I asked you to use parentheses to split the problem into sums of two numbers, how would you do it?

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

Here is one way you could do it:

![Figure 1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/1.2.4_fig1.gif?token=APLSS6PZDJUJURYCO4KUZ7DANZKA4)

You start by separating the problem into two subproblems:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
(1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5))
```

Now we continue doing so until we can no longer divide the problem into two subproblems:

```
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
(1 + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5))
(1 + (2 + (3 + 4 + 5)))
(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + 5))))
(1 + (2 + (3 + (4 + (5)))))
```

Let's see if we can use this example to write a recursive function to sum a list of numbers.

The first thing we need to consider for our recursive function is how to know when to stop adding parentheses.

When we add the first set, we ask — what is the sum of the first item and the sum of the rest of the items?

![Figure 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/1.2.4_fig2.gif?token=APLSS6LOPBGJTQS6H5ETFXLANZKMS)

But, as we continue dividing the problem into subproblems, we "run out" of the "rest of items." Once we no longer have a list of items longer than one, we cannot break the list into the first item and the rest of the items. So if someone asks us to sum one number, we know that the result is equal to that number. This "running out" is the base case for our recursive function.

**Note:**  
*We usually place the base case of a recursive function in the first few lines of the function, though it doesn't have to be there.*

Let's start writing out our function in pseudocode:

```
sum_list(items)
    if the length of items is one
        return the one item in the list
```

But what if someone asks us to sum more than one item? We must sum the first number and the sum of the rest of the items in the list.

Let's add this to our pseudocode:

```
sum_list(items)
    if the length of items is one
        return the one item in the list
    otherwise
        return the first item from the list
         + sum_list(the rest of the items)
```

Now let's convert our pseudocode into actual Python code:

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1:
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:])
```

Now that we have our function defined let's see what happens when we call it.

![Figure 3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/1.2.4_fig3.gif?token=APLSS6JP3QQVQXZDQFB572LANZLMW)

You can see how the recursive calls go "out" before returning and starting working their way "back" to the original call.

### An even simpler example
Maybe you're still confused. Let's write a `recursive function` that can `print each integer` from `n` down to `0`.

We start by writing our function in pseudocode.

```
print_to_zero(n):
    print n
    if n is 0
        return
    return print_to_zero(n - 1)
```

The first line of our pseudocode function prints the value of `n`. Then, we check the `base case` — is `n` equal to `0` — and, if it is, we `return` and `stop recursing`. Our pseudocode's final return is our recursive case, where we decrement the previous call's `n` value and call the function itself with that decremented value (the recursive case).

Let's turn it into actual Python code and then look at a visualization of the call stack when we call this function.

```
def print_to_zero(n):
    print(n)
    if n == 0: # base case
        return
    return print_to_zero(n - 1) # recursive case
```

![Figure 4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/1.2.4_fig4.gif?token=APLSS6NQPUGRSEYOOBLU2LTANZMAK)

One thing you might've realized is that our current function doesn't handle inputs of less than `0`. Ideally, our function should take these inputs without getting stuck in an infinite recursion (which would lead to a stack overflow).

Let's modify our function so that it handles inputs of less than zero.

```
def print_to_zero(n):
    if n < 0: # base case
        return
    print(n)
    return print_to_zero(n - 1) # recursive case
```

### Three rules of recursion
Let's use our `sum_list` function to see if we can make more generalized observations about recursion.

The three rules for a recursive function are:

1. Must have a base case
2. Must change its state to move towards the base case
3. Must call itself

### 1. Must have a base case
The first rule for recursion is that a recursive algorithm **must have a base case**.

**What is a base case?**  
- It allows the algorithm to stop recursing. With our sum_list function, what allows the algorithm to stop recursing?

It's the first line: `if len(items) == 1:`. Notice how if this condition is `true`, it `returns a value` and `doesn't make a recursive call` to itself. We are saying to stop recursing if the list to sum has only one item.

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1: # Base Case
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:])
```

### 2. Must change its state to move towards the base case
The second rule is that the algorithm **must change its state to move towards the base case**.

**How does our function do that?**  
- With each subsequent recursion, the list passed into `sum_list` is `one item smaller`. For example, on the `first recursion`, items is `[2,3,4,5]`, and on the `subsequent recursion`, items is `[3,4,5]`.

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1: # Base Case
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:]) # items[1:] has one less item
```

It's obvious then that regardless of the list's length, we will reach the base case where the list we are summing has only one item.

### 3. Must call itself
The third rule is that the algorithm **must call itself**. We are doing this on the final line of the function.

```
def sum_list(items):
    if len(items) == 1: # Base Case
        return items[0]
    else:
        return items[0] + sum_list(items[1:]) # Calls sum_list recursively
```

![Figure 5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.2_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_I/images/1.2.4_fig5.gif?token=APLSS6PY3QK55LUI6APBHQDANZNRS)

### When should I use recursion?
Now that we've considered one recursive algorithm and discussed the three recursion rules, we should think about when it is appropriate to use recursion.

When you are out in the world solving real-world problems, the problem itself doesn't say, "Hey! You should use recursion to solve me!" It's your job as the problem-solver to decide if using recursion makes sense.

So, what clues or hints might you find within a problem that could lead you to use recursion?

- Compute the nth term
- List the first or last n terms
- Generate all permutations

Another way to think about it is to use the three rules. *Is there a clear base case or stopping point that you are working towards (Rule 1)?* *Is there a straightforward way that the state of the data changes with each iteration that brings it closer to the base case (Rule 2)?*

### Follow Along
Let's look at another typical example of learning recursion–computing factorials.

A factorial (`n!`) is computed by taking `n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... 1`.

For example, `4!` is computed by doing the following:

`4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)`

`4 * 3 * 2 * 1`

`24`

**When does computing factorials come in handy?**  
- They are required when `figuring combinations`; how many ways can we arrange these many items? Or how many orders can there be with this list? Also, they are useful for determining ways of choosing a certain number of items from a collection. For example, if you have `100 different menu items`, how many possible `5-item orders` could you make?

Okay, let's get back to our `4!` example. Let's look again at the computation and see if we can make some connections to our three rules for recursion.

`4! = 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)`

First, how did we know to stop writing? Why didn't we keep going?

`4! = 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3) * (4 - 4) * (4 - 5) * (4 - 6) * ...`

Well, before, when talking about the general case, we wrote factorial like this:

`n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... 1`

What is the last item in the procedure, or how did we know to stop? When the item is `1`. Could this serve as the base case for our recursive factorial function? Let's try it out!

We start by writing pseudocode.

```
recursive_factorial(n)
    if n equals 1
        return 1
```

Okay, so now we have a base case (Rule 1). But what about changing the state to move towards the base case (Rule 2)?

Let's look again at `4!`.

`4! = 4 * (4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * (4 - 3)`

Notice that just like we can write `4!` as `4 * (4 - 1) * ... 1`, we can write `(4 - 1)!` as `(4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * ... 1`. So the inverse would also be true; we can write `(4 - 1) * (4 - 2) * ... 1` as `(4 - 1)!`. Which means we can write `4!` as `4 * (4 - 1)!`.

Okay, we can't miss what we just discovered. Our discovery means that we can express factorial in terms of itself. For any n! we can solve it by breaking it into smaller sub-problems that also require factorial (Rule 3). And Rule 2 is satisfied because we make each subsequent call to factorial on a smaller n.

recursive_factorial(n)
    if n equals 1
        return 1
    otherwise
        return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)
Now we need to convert our pseudocode into actual Python code. Luckily, in Python, this is usually a trivial change.

def recursive_factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * recursive_factorial(n - 1)
