### [Binary Search - Iterative - LeetCode Practice](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/)

**Description:**  
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
    nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 
    4
Explanation: 
    9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2:**

```Input: 
    nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: 
    -1
Explanation: 
    2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-9999 <= nums[i], target <= 9999`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in `ascending order`.

```
"""
Test Cases:
nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12]
target = 9
output --> 4
"""

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        # Create a start at 0 and end at the length of nums - 1
        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        
        # Iterate through nums while start is less than or equal to end
        while start <= end:
            # Reassign the middle location with each iteration 
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            
            # Check if the middle value is the target value
            if nums[mid] == target:
                # We are done, return middle index number
                return mid
            
            # Check if the mdiddle value is less than the target value
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                # Search to the right of the middle
                start = mid + 1
            
            else:
                # Search to the left of the middle
                end = mid - 1
        
        # If the target was not found, return -1
        return -1

### [Guess Number Higher or Lower - Iterative - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)

**Description:**

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int `guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

- `-1`: The number I picked is `lower` than your guess (i.e. pick < num).
- `1`: The number I picked is `higher` than your guess (i.e. pick > num).
- `0`: The number I picked is `equal` to your guess (i.e. pick == num).

Return *the number that I picked*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`

```
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:


class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        # start at 1, no 0 will be given, and end at n (highest number)
        start, end = 1, n
        
        # While start does not equal end
        while start <= end:
            # Middle of the list remaining
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            # Result will hold the middle value as a guess using LeetCode defined function.
            res = guess(mid)
            
            # Check if res is the target
            if res == 0:
                # Return the middle value
                return mid
            
            # Check if our guess is less than the result
            elif res == -1:
                # Search values to the left of the current middle
                end = mid - 1
            
            else:
                # Search values to the right of the current middle
                start = mid + 1

        return -1
```

### [First Bad Version - ](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)

**Description:**

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1

```
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return an integer
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # start is the 1st version, end is n which is the length to the current version
        start, end = 1, n
        
        # Iterate through the version list until start and end meet
        while start <= end:
            # Get the middle value
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            
            # Check if it is a bad version using the function provided
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                # Search to the left of the middle
                end = mid - 1
                
            else:
                # Search to the right of the middle
                start = mid + 1
                
        return start
    
```

```
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorical(n - 1)
    
factorial(3)  --> 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1

output --> 120
```

```
fib(n) = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

def fib(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
        
    if n == 1:
        return 1
        
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)
    
fib(3)
```

**NOTE:** Look up Dynamic Programming

```
# Doing it Dynamically using Tabulation
def tabfib(n):
    fibs = [0, 1]
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fibs.append(fibs[i - 1] + fibs[i - 2])
   
    return fibs[n]
```
