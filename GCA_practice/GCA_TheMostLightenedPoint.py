"""
There are some lamps placed on a coordinate line. Each of these lamps illuminates some space around it within a given radius. You are given the coordinates of the lamps on the line, and the effective radius of each of the lamps' light.

In other words, you are given a two-dimensional array lamps, where lamps[i] contains information about the ith lamp. lamps[i][0] is an integer representing the lamp's coordinate, and lamps[i][1] is a positive integer representing the effective radius of the ith lamp. That means that the ith lamp illuminates everything in a range from lamps[i][0] - lamps[i][1] to lamps[i][0] + lamps[i][1] inclusive.

Your task is to find the coordinate of the point that is illuminated by the highest number of lamps. In case of a tie, return the point among them with the minimal possible coordinate.

Example

For lamps = [[-2, 3], [2, 3], [2, 1]], the output should be theMostLightenedPoint(lamps) = 1.

The first lamp illuminates everything in range [-2 - 3, -2 + 3] = [-5, 1].
The second lamp illuminates everything in range [2 - 3, 2 + 3] = [-1, 5].
The third lamp illuminates everything in range [2 - 1, 2 + 1] = [1, 3].
The only point that is illuminated by all of the lamps is 1, hence the answer is 1.

For lamps = [[-2, 1], [2, 1]], the output should be theMostLightenedPoint(lamps) = -3.

The given lamps illuminate ranges [-3, -1] and [1, 3] respectively. Every point in these ranges are illuminated by only 1 lamp, but the one with the minimal coordinate among them is -3, so it is the answer.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] array.array.integer lamps

A two-dimensional array containing information about the lamps. Each lamp is described by a two-element array containing the coordinate and the effective radius of the lamp.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ lamps.length ≤ 105,
lamps[i].length = 2,
-109 ≤ lamps[i][0] ≤ 109,
1 ≤ lamps[i][1] ≤ 105.

[output] integer

The coordinate of the point with the smallest coordinate that is illuminated by the most number of lamps.
