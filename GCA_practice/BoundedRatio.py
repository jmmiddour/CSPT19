"""
You are given an array of integers a and two integers l and r. You task is to calculate a boolean array b, where b[i] = true if there exists an integer x, such that a[i] = (i + 1) * x and l ≤ x ≤ r. Otherwise, b[i] should be set to false.

Example

For a = [8, 5, 6, 16, 5], l = 1, and r = 3, the output should be boundedRatio(a, l, r) = [false, false, true, false, true].

For a[0] = 8, we need to find a value of x such that 1 * x = 8, but the only value that would work is x = 8 which doesn't satisfy the boundaries 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, so b[0] = false.
For a[1] = 5, we need to find a value of x such that 2 * x = 5, but there is no integer value that would satisfy this equation, so b[1] = false.
For a[2] = 6, we can choose x = 2 because 3 * 2 = 6 and 1 ≤ 2 ≤ 3, so b[2] = true.
For a[3] = 16, there is no an integer 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, such that 4 * x = 16, so b[3] = false.
For a[4] = 5, we can choose x = 1 because 5 * 1 = 5 and 1 ≤ 1 ≤ 3, so b[4] = true.

[input] array.integer a

An array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ a.length ≤ 100,
1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 106.

[input] integer l

An integer representing the lower bound for x.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ l ≤ 104.

[input] integer r

An integer representing the upper bound for x.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ r ≤ 104,
l ≤ r.

[output] array.boolean

A boolean array.

[Python 3] Syntax Tips

# Prints help message to the console
# Returns a string

    print "This prints to the console when you Run Tests"
    return "Hello, " + name

Assumptions:
- `a` length will be from 1 - 100.
- `a` values will be from 1 - 10^6.
- `l` value will be from 1 - 10^4.
- `r` value will be from 1 - 10^4.

Inputs:
`a` = An array of intergers
`l` = An integer that represents the lower bound for `x`
`r` = An integer that represents the upper bound for `x`

Output:
`b` = An array of booleans stating True if `a[i] = (i +1) * x` and `l <= x <= 
r`. 
`x` = the value that you multiple by the index number of the next element in 
the array to get the value at `a[i]`.

Test Cases:
a = [8, 5, 6, 16, 5]
l = 1
r = 3
output --> [false, false, true, false, true]

a = [9, 6, 5, 8]
l = 1
r = 5
worked out --> a[0] = 9 = False, a[1] = 3 = True, a[2] = (can not do 5/3) = 
False, a[3] = 2 = True
output --> [False, True, False, True]

Plan:
1. Create a list to hold boolean values.
2. Iterate through the `a` array to check the values against the formula.
3. Add the boolean value for each index to the boolean list.
4. Return the boolean list.
