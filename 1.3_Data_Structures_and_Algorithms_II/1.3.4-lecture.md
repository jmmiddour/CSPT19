## DEPTH-FIRST VS BREADTH-FIRST
- **Depth-first:** Traverse in a depth-ward motion using a **stack/recursion**
- **Breadth-first:** Traverse in a breadth-ward motion using a **queue**

## NOTE ON GRAPH TRAVERSALS
- Sometimes, it doesnâ€™t matter whether you do a depth-first or breadth-first search
- Breadth-first Search is **very useful** for finding the **shortest path** from a source to a destination

## HOW TO SOLVE ANY GRAPH PROBLEM
- Translate the problem into graph terminology
    - What are the vertices, edges, weights (if needed)?
- Build your graph
    - Do you even need to build a graph? Should you use an adjacency matrix/list?
- Traverse your graph
    - Should you use BFS/DFS? Do you need an auxiliary data structure?

## ALL PATHS FROM SOURCE TO TARGET
- [797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/submissions/)

**Problem Description:**

Medium Problem

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_1.jpg)

```
graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_2.jpg)

```
graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: graph = [[1],[]]
Output: [[0,1]]
```

**Example 4:**

```
graph = [[1,2,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,2,3],[0,3]]
```

**Example 5:**

```
graph = [[1,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,3]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `n == graph.length`
- `2 <= n <= 15`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
- `graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
- The input graph is **guaranteed** to be a **DAG**.

## FLOOD FILL
[733. Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)

**Problem Description:**

An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from `0` to `65535`).

Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel `(row and column)` of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.

To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the `newColor`.

At the end, return the modified image.

**Example 1:**
 
```
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]
sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.
```

**Note:**

- The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
- The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length` and `0 <= sc < image[0].length`.
- The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and `newColor` will be an integer in `[0, 65535]`.

```
class Solution:
    """
    Test Case:
    image = [[1, 1, 1],
             [1, 1, 0],
             [1, 0, 1]]
     output = [[2, 2, 2],
               [2, 2, 0],
               [2, 0, 1]]

    Plan:
    1. Translate the problem into graph terminology
        Not exactly like a graph, but a matrix is very similar to it
        vertex - an element in the matrix
        edge - elements that are right next to it
    2. Build the graph
        No need to build a graph, we can just traverse the actual matrix
    3. Traverse the graph/matrix
        Traversal doesn't matter. All we need to do is traverse from the origin point and change the other node's colors if needed
