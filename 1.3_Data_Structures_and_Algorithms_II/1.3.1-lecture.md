### Binary Trees

- Comprised as nodes.
- Holds a value (usually a sting or number)
- Each node can have up to 2 children
- A node with no children is called a *leaf*
- Can have different properties (BST, balanced, complete, perfect, etc.)
- Binary Search Trees always have the lesser value (of the current node) on the left, and the greater value on the right.
- The appearance of a binary tree can look many ways.
- Nodes can also have duplicate or negative values.
    - Realizing this is helpful when creating test cases!

### Binary Tree Class Definition
- Initialize a node with a value
- Optional left and right properties
- This is usually how a binary tree is represented in interviews:
    ```
    class BinaryTreeNode:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
    
    a = BinaryTreeNode('a')
    b = BinaryTreeNode('b')
    c = BinaryTreeNode('c')
    d = BinaryTreeNode('d')
    
    a.left = b
    a.right = c
    b.left = d
  
    # The tree would look like this:
    
            A
           / \
          B   C
         /
        D
    ```
    ```
    # Beej's Example:
    class TreeNode:
        def __init__(self, value):
            self.value = value
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
    
    root = TreeNode(3)
    root.left = TreeNode(1)
    root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
    root.right = TreeNode(4)
    root.right.right = TreeNode(5)
  
    # The tree would look like this:
    
            3
          /   \
         /     \
        1       4
       / \     / \
     Nan  2   /   \
            Nan    5
    ```
- Beej's Search function on the above Binary Tree:
    ```
    def search(root, value):
        cur = root
        
        while cur is not None:
            # Compare to see if we found it
            if cur.value == value:
                return True  # if we found it.
  
            # If not, go to the proper next node to search
            if value < cur.value:
                cur = cur.left
            
            else:  # value > cur.value
                cur = cur.right
  
        # If we make it here, we didn't find it
        return False
  
    print(search(root, 2))
    print(search(root, 5))
    print(search(root, 99))
  
    OUTPUT:
        True
        True
        False
    ```
- Beej's Recursive Search function on the above binary tree:
    ```
    def search_recur(cur, value):
        # search for a node:
        #   checking if this node is what we're looking for
        #   If the value we want less than current:
        #       Return search for node (left)
        #   Else:
        #       Return search for node (right)
  
        if cur is None:  # Edge case
            return False
  
        if cur.value == value:  # Found the value
            return True
  
        if value < cur.value:  # 
            return search_recur(cur.left, value)
  
        else:
            return search_recur(cur.right, value)
    ```

### Tree Traversals

- Binary Tree problems require you to traverse the tree and/or manipulate/get values from it.

- Two ways to Traverse:

    - **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
        - **In-Order** (left, current, right):
            - *In-Order = Left to Right*

            - *This traversal in a BST gives you the sorted order*

            - Reverse In-Order (right, current, left)
    
            - Beej's Implementation of In-Order searching the above tree.
                ```
                # Recursive Solution:
                def in_order(cur):
                    # If we hit a None Node
                    if cur is None:
                        print('Hit a None')
                        # Returns to the last node seen
                        return
              
                    # Recursive call to go left
                    print('Going Left')
                    in_order(cur.left)
                    # Print the current value
                    print(cur.value)
                    # Recursive call to go right
                    print('Going Right')
                    in_order(cur.right)
              
                in_order(root)
                
                OUTPUT:
                    Going Left

        - If you are going to implement iteratively, need to use a `Stack` data structure to keep track of where you are.

        - **Keywords:** *max, deepest, longest*

    - Breadth-First Search (BFS):

        - Level-Order

        - Beej's implementation of max depth function:
            ```
            def max_depth(root):
                if root is None:
                    return 0
          
                left_depth = max_depth(root.left)
                right_depth = max_depth(root.right)
                
                return max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1
          
            print(max_depth(root))
          
            OUTPUT --> 3
            ```
          
        - Need to use a `Queue` to keep track of where you are if implementing iteratively.

### Implementing DFS

- Can be implemented iteratively or recursively.

- At the very minimum, be able to do pre / post / in-order traversals.

### [Implement In-order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal)

**Problem Description:**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the inorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder_1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 4:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder_5.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
 

**Follow up:**

- Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

```

### [Implement Preorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal)

### Different Properties of Binary Trees

- Most Common:

    - Balanced / Non-Balanced

    - Binary Search Tree (BST)

- Not as Common:

    - Full, Perfect, Complete, Degenerate, etc.

- Binary Trees can have multiple properties

    - Balanced BST, Non-Balanced BST, Complete BST, etc.

- ***Hint:***  
    *Tree properties are usually hints! 
    Always ask your interviewer if a tree has special properties.*

### Balanced Binary Trees

- Height of left and right subtree of every node differs at most by 1.

- Height = The max distance of any node from the root.

- ***Hint:***  
    *Balanced / Non-Balance trees impact the runtime complexity for trees, especially BST's*

- [National Institute of Standards and Technology - height definition](https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/height.html)

### Binary Search Trees (BST)

- Left subtree contains children <= root

- Right subtree contains children > root

- Better lookup and insert performance than non-BST's

    - *Caveat: only it they are balanced*

- ***Hint:***  
    *The properties of a BST are usually needed ot get the optimal solution.*

### Cool Properties of BST's

- A ***balanced*** BST has `O(log n)` performance for get, insert, delete operations.

- Traversing a BST using an in-order traversal gets the ascending order. 

- How would you get the descending order?

    - Using Reverse In-Order

### Time / Space Complexity

- Time complexities usually differ depending on:

    - If the tree is a BST or not.

    - It the tree is balanced / non-balanced
    
- **Remember your time and space complexities, interviewers will ask!**

- Always preface your assumptions

    - "*If this BST was balanced / non-balanced, the runtime would be...*"

### Perfect Binary Trees

- Every level is completely filled

- Every node has either 2 children or None

- A perfect binary tree is also balanced.

### Degenerate Binary Trees

- Also called a *pathological* tree

- Every node has at most 1 child

- This is usually why runtime / space complexity is `O(n)` for trees (especially BST's)

### Valid BST

- Check if a tree is a valid BST

### [Validate Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-binary-search-tree/)

**Problem Description:**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, *determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)*.

A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.

- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.

- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg)

```
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false

Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1`
