## Intro to Graphs

- A very versatile data structure that allows you to represent relationships between data
    - Social network, flight schedule, word relationships, etc.
    
Graphs have "edges" that are essentially their pointers.

## Components of a Graph

- **Vertex** - also called nodes

- **Edge** - connects a pair of nodes
    - There are two types of edges:
        - *Unidirectional* - Path from A to B but there’s no path from B to A
        - *Bidirectional* - A is friends with B, then B is friends with A

- **Weight** - used to represent a value associated with the edge (usually a cost)

## Examples of Graphs
- **Social Networks**
    - Each node is a user, edges are friendships between nodes

    - Edges can also be to which groups you are a part of

- **Transportation Systems** (BART, Maps, etc.)
    - Each `node` is a `location`, each `edge` is a `route` to another one. A weight can represent time to get there

- **The Internet!**
    - Each `page` can be represented as a `node`, a `directed edge` is a `link` to another web page
    
## Graph Propeerties

- A graph can have multiple properties

- Knowing these different properties are important, so you can build/solve graph problems!

## Directed -vs- Undirected

- A graph can be either `directed` or `undirected`
- **Directed** - An `edge` from `A to B` `doesn’t` mean there’s an edge from `B to A`
- **Undirected** - An `edge` from `A to B` means `there’s also` an edge from `B to A`

## Cyclic -vs- Acyclic

- Applies to **directed** graphs
- **Cyclic** - there’s `at least one path` from a `node back to itself`
- **Acyclic** - there are `no paths` such that no node can be traversed back to itself
- A tree is a directed acyclic graph!

## Dense -vs- Sparse

- A graph can be `sparse/dense` or anything in between
- **Dense** - contains close to the `maximum edges` possible
- **Sparse** - contains close to the `minimum edges` possible

## Weighted -vs- Unweighted

- A graph can either be `weighted` or `unweighted`
- Weight determines a value associated with an edge (usually a cost)
- **Weighted** - Each edge has an associated value
- **Unweighted** - Each edge has no associated value

## Adjacency List

- Use a dictionary with sets to represent the edges of a particular vertex to other neighboring vertices
- adjacencyList[i] is a set of all the edges to its neighbors for vertex i

```
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.graph)
        
    def add_node(self, value):
        if value not in self.graph:
            self.graph[value] = set()
        
    def remove_node(self, value):
        if value in self.graph:
            self.graph.pop(value)
            for others in self.graph:
                if value in self.graph[others]:
                    self.graph[others].remove(value)
    
    def add_edge(self, from, to):
        self.graph[from].add(to)
    
    def remove_edge(self, from, to):
        self.graph[from].remove[to]
    
    def edge_exists(self, from, to):
        return to in self.graph[from]
    
my_graph = Graph()
my_graph.add_node(1)
my_graph.add_node(2)
my_graph.add_node(3)
my_graph.add_node(4)
my_graph.add_edge(1, 2)
my_graph.add_edge(1, 3)
my_graph.add_edge(2, 4)
my_graph.add_edge(3, 4)
my_graph.add_edge(4, 1)
my_graph.remove_edge()
print(my_graph.edge_exists(4, 1))
print(my_graph.edge_exists(3, 1))
my_graph.remove_node(4)
print(my_graph)
```

## Adjacency List Runtime/Space Complexity

- Space: `O(vertices^2)`
    - Imagine a dense graph
- Add vertex: `O(1)`
- Remove vertex: `O(vertices)`
- Add edge: `O(1)`
- Remove edge: `O(1)`
- Find edge: `O(1)`
- Get all edges: `O(1)`

## Adjacency Matrix

- Use a matrix to represent whether or not there exists an edge between two vertices
- matrix[i][j] is True if there exists an edge from vertex i to vertex j

## Adjacency Matrix Runtime/Space Complexities

- Space: O(vertices2)
    - Even in a sparse graph, but good for dense graphs b/c lists are space efficient
- Add vertex: O(vertices2)
- Remove vertex: O(vertices2)
- Add edge: O(1)
- Remove edge: O(1)
- Find edge: O(1)
- Get all edges: O(vertices)

## Adjacency Matrix -vs- Adjacency Lists

|  | Space | Add Vertices | Remove Vertices | Add Edge | Remove Edge | Find Edge | Get All Edges |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adj. Matrix | O(V2) | O(V2) | O(V2) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(V) |
| Adj. List | O(V2) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |

- The best representation mainly depends on whether or not the graph is sparse/dense and what you’re optimizing for (space/runtime)
- If you’re optimizing for space, representing dense graphs are probably better with adj. matrix because lists are very space efficient in comparison to dictionaries/sets
- You’ll probably deal with more adjacency lists

## Graph Traversals
- There are two primary ways to traverse a graph: `Depth-first` and `Breadth-first`
- Traversal vs. Search
    - In a search, you stop once you find the node you’re searching for
    - In a traversal, you traverse the entire graph
    
- Depth-First Traversal:
    - Traverse the graph in a depth-ward motion using a stack/recursion
    - Pseudocode:
        ```
        function dfs_iterative(G, v)
            s = stack
            s.push(v)
            
            while s is not empty:
                v = s.pop()
                if v is not labeled as discovered:
                    label v as discovered
                    for all edges from v to w in g.adjacent_edges(v):
                        s.push(w)
        ```
```
from collections import deque

def dft(graph, start_node):
# Impliment a stack using a double ended queue
s = deque()
# Append the starting node to stack
s.append(start_node)
# Create a visited list to prevent from going back to a node already visited
visited = set()

# While there is something still in the stack
while len(s) > 0:
    # Pop the last value off the stack and make that the current node
    curr = s.pop()
    
    # If the current node is not in the visited list yet
    if curr not in visited:
        # Add the current node to the visited list
        visitied.add(curr)
        # Print the current node
        print(curr)
        
        # Iterate through the graph at current node to get the neighbors for the current node
        for neighbors in graph[curr]:
            # Append the neighbors to the top of the stack
            s.append(neighbors)
```

    - Recursive DFT pseudocode:
        ```
        function dft_rec(g, v)
            label v as discovered
            for all directed edges from v to w that are in g.adjacent_edges(v)
                if vertex w is not labeled as discovered
                    recursively call dft_rec(g, w)
        ```
  
- Breadth-First Traversal
    - Traverse the graph in a breadth-ward motion using a queue
    - Very useful for finding shortest path from node to node
        ```
        
        ```
        ```
        
        ```

## [How to Interpret a Graph as a 2D array with Sean](https://youtu.be/oK9mN30jLMI?t=182)

For the following `Graph`:  
```
0 -----> 1
|        |
V        V
2 -----> 3
         |
         V
         4

           0      1    2    3    4
array = [[1, 2], [3], [3], [4], []]

As an adjacency list:
adj_list = {
        0: {1, 2}, 
        1: {3}, 
        2: {3}, 
        3: {4},
        4: {}
        }
```

To create the adjacency list above you can do it in a dictionary comprehension:  
    `adj_list = {k:set(v) for k, v in enumerate(array)}`

## [Demonstration 1 with Sean](https://youtu.be/oK9mN30jLMI?t=1569)

**Problem Description:**

You are given an undirected graph with its maximum degree (the degree of a node is the number of edges connected to the node).

You need to write a function that can take an undirected graph as its argument and color the graph legally (a legal graph coloring is when no adjacent nodes have the same color).

The number of colors necessary to complete a legal coloring is always one more than the graph's maximum degree.

* **Note:**
    - *We can color a graph in linear time and space. Also, make sure that your solution can handle a loop in a reasonable way.*
    
```
colors = set(["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Purple", "Yellow"])

# Function to color the graph
# Brute force approach

    # Iterate through the nodes in the graph

        # Figure out what colors are illegal based on the nieghbors colors
        # illegal_colors = []  # If a list, O(C) for time when iterating through the values.
        # illegal_colors = set()  # If a set vs list, gives O(1) vs O(C) for time when iterating through the values.
        # Create the illegal colors using a list comprehension in a set
        # illegal_colors = set([neighbor.color for neighbor in node.neighbors if neighbor.color])
        # Create the illegal colors using a set comprehension
        illegal_colors = {neighbor.color for neighbor in node.neighbors if neighbor.color}
        
        # Having the set comprehension above, do not need this for loop now.

        for color in colors:  # T: O(C)
            if color not in illegal_colors:  # T: O(1)
                node.color = color
                break

## [Demonstration 2 with Sean](https://youtu.be/oK9mN30jLMI?t=5605)

**Problem Description:**

You are given a 2D grid of `1` and `0` that represent a "map". The `1` represent land and the `0` represent water.

You need to write a function that, given a "map" as an argument, counts the number of islands. Islands are defined as adjacent pieces of land that are connected horizontally or vertically. You can also assume that the edges of the map are surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```
grid = [
    ['1', '1', '1', '1', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '1', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '0', '0']
]

output = 1
```

Example 2:
```
grid = [
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['1', '1', '0', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '1', '0', '0'],
    ['0', '0', '0', '1', '1']
]

output = 3
```

```
from collections import deque

def numIslands(grid):
    # Create a counter
    count = 0
    
    # Need to find all of the 1's
    # Iterate through the matrix using nested for loops
    for row_idx, row in enumerate(grid):
        for col_idx, digit in enumerate(row):
            # Increament the counter when a 1 is seen
            if digit == '1':
                counter += 1
            # Keep track of the seen 1's so no double counting
                # If a 1 is seen, after we processed it, change that 1 to a 0
                grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0
                # Find out how far the island extends in the horizontal and vertical directions
                queue = deque([(row_idx, col_idx])
            # Process the 1's adjacent to the current 1
                while len(queue) > 0:
                    r, c = queue.popleft()
                    # Check the 4 cardinal directions around the current 1
                    # If any more 1's seen, add them to queue
                    
                    # Look to the North
                    if r > 0 and grid[r-1][c] == '1':
                        grid[r-1][c] = 0
                        queue.append((r-1, c))
                    
                    # Look to the South
                    if r < len(grid) - 1 and grid[r+1][c] == '1':
                        grid[r+1][c] = 0
                        queue.append((r+1, c))
                        
                    # Look to the East
                    if c < len(row) - 1 and grid[r][c+1] == '1':
                        grid[r][c+1] = 0
                        queue.append((r, c+1))
                        
                    # Look to the West
                    if c > 0 and grid[r][c-1] == '1':
                        grid[r][c-1] = 0
                        queue.append((r, c-1))
    return counter
```
