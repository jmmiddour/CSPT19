"""
You are given a non-empty array of integers.

One element appears exactly once, with every other element appearing
	at least twice, perhaps more.

Write a function that can find and return the element that appears exactly once.

Example 1:

Input: [1,1,2,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,1,2,1,2,80]
Output: 80
Note: You should be able to develop a solution that has O(n) time complexity.

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] array.integer nums
