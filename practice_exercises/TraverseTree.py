Note:
	Try to solve this task without using recursion, since this is what
		you'll be asked to do during an interview.

Given a binary tree of integers `t`,
	return its node values in the following format:

- The first element should be the value of the tree root;
- The next elements should be the values of the nodes at height 1 (i.e. the
	root children), ordered from the leftmost to the rightmost one;
- The elements after that should be the values of the nodes at height 2 (i.e.
	the children of the nodes at height 1) ordered in the same way;
- Etc.

Example:

For t = {
	"value": 1,
	"left": {
		"value": 2,
		"left": null,
		"right": {
			"value": 3,
			"left": null,
			"right": null
		}
	},
	"right": {
		"value": 4,
		"left": {
			"value": 5,
			"left": null,
			"right": null
		},
		"right": null
	}
}

the output should be:
	traverseTree(t) = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].

This `t` looks like this:

     1
   /   \
  2     4
   \   /
    3 5

Input/Output:

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] tree.integer t
	Guaranteed constraints:
		0 â‰¤ tree size â‰¤ 104.

[output] array.integer
	An array that contains the values at t's nodes, ordered as described above.
