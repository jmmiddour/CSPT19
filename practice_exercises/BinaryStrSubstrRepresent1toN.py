LeetCode: 1016: Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N
(Medium difficulty)

Given a binary string `S` (a string consisting only of '0' and '1's) and
	a positive integer `N`, return `True` if and only if, for every integer `X`
	from `1` to `N`, the binary representation of `X` is a substring of `S`.

Example 1:

	Input: `S = "0110", N = 3`
	Output: `True`

Example 2:

	Input: `S = "0110", N = 4`
	Output: `False`

Note:

	`1 <= S.length <= 1000`
	`1 <= N <= 10^9`
