"""
Two words are
	blanagrams: (blank + anagram; a word which is an anagram of another but
		for the substitution of a single letter; In Scrabble, a blank tile
		on the player's rack that may be used to form any of several
		possible words in conjunction with the player's other tiles)
	if they are anagrams (А string `x` is an anagram of a string `y` if one
		can get `y` by rearranging the letters of `x`.
		For example, the strings `"MITE"` and `"TIME"` are anagrams,
		so are `"BABA"` and `"AABB"`, but `"ABBAC"` and `"CAABA"` are not.)
	but exactly one letter has been substituted for another.

Given two words, check if they are blanagrams of each other.

Example:

For `word1 = "tangram"` and `word2 = "anagram"`, the output should be:
	checkBlanagrams(word1, word2) = True;

- After changing the first letter 't' to 'a' in the word1,
	the words become anagrams.

For `word1 = "tangram"` and `word2 = "pangram"`, the output should be:
	checkBlanagrams(word1, word2) = True.

- Since a word is an anagram of itself (a so-called trivial anagram), we are
	not obliged to rearrange letters. Only the substitution of a single letter
	is required for a word to be a blanagram, and here 't' is changed to 'p'.

For `word1 = "aba"` and `word2 = "bab"`, the output should be:
	checkBlanagrams(word1, word2) = True.

- You can take the first letter 'a' of word1 and change it to 'b', obtaining
	the word "bba", which is an anagram of word2 = "bab". It is also possible
	to change the first letter 'b' of word2 to 'a' and obtain "aab", which is
	an anagram of word1 = "aba".

For `word1 = "silent"` and `word2 = "listen"`, the output should be:
	checkBlanagrams(word1, word2) = False.

- These two words are anagrams of each other, but no letter substitution was
	made (the trivial substitution of a letter with itself shouldn't be
	considered), so they are not blanagrams.

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] string word1
	A string consisting of lowercase letters.

[input] string word2
	A string consisting of lowercase letters.

	Guaranteed constraints:
		word2.length = word1.length.

[output] boolean
	Return True if word1 and word2 are blanagrams of each other,
		otherwise return False.
