"""
You are given a binary tree and you need to write a function that
	can determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced tree can be defined as a binary tree in which the
	left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by a
	maximum of 1.

Example 1:

Given the following tree `[5,10,25,None,None,12,3]`:

```
    5
   / \
 10  25
    /  \
   12   3
```Add

return `True`.

Example 2:

Given the following tree `[5,6,6,7,7,None,None,8,8]`:

```
       5
      / \
     6   6
    / \
   7   7
  / \
 8   8
```

return False.
