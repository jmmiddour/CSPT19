## Hash Tables: Things to know

- There’s many use-cases for hash-tables in programming problems
- Hash-and-store: Use O(1) get/store/delete operations in dictionaries/sets to solve the problem faster, at the expense of additional space

## [771. Jewels and Stones](https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/)

**Problem Description:**

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are `jewels`, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= jewels.length`, `stones.length <= 50`
- `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
- All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.

```

## [1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/how-many-numbers-are-smaller-than-the-current-number/)

**Problem Description:**

Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid `j's` such that `j != i` **and** `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation: 
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]
```

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 500`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

```

## Other Types of Interviews

- There are other types of interviews besides general data structure/algorithmic interviews
- Other common types of interviews:
    - Screening (usually first interview)
    - Behavioral (soft skills)
    - Role-specific (techincal based on your role)
    - System Design (more for senior roles)
- Allocate your practice accordingly depending on the companies you’re applying for
    - Different companies care about different skills
    - It is okay to ask ahead of time what type of things you need to prepare for.

## Screening Interviews

- Usually the first interview when applying
- Evaluate your qualifications and see if you would be a potential fit for the role
- Clarify any questions about your resume
- Ask about motivations in applying and what you’re looking for
- Mostly non-technical and conducted by recruiters

## Behavioral Interviews

- Understand your behavior in a working environment
- Ask about your soft-skills and working experience in a team
- There’s usually at least one round of this during full-time/intern interviews
- Usually conducted by managers

## STAR Method

- A popular framework to answer behavioral questions
- Tell me about a challenging situation you had at work
- **S**ituation - Setup and describe the situation
    - *I was on-call and I got an alert that errors for our main backend service were spiking in the middle of the night.*
- **T**ask - Explain your responsibility in the situation
    - *As on-call, my role is to make sure our services are stable and to triage/mitigate escalations when they happen.*
- **A**ction - Describe the actions you took to accomplish the task
    - *I looked at the timeline for when the errors started, along with the changes that were made at that time. I found the offending change and reverted it.*
- **R**esults - State the outcome of your actions
    - *The errors, which affected X users was mitigated in Y minutes. I also led a post-mortem afterwards, which led to creating more automated tests to prevent it from happening again.*

## Role-Specific Interviews

- Deep-dive into your domain-specific knowledge (e.g. iOS, Android, Front-end Web, AI/ML, etc.)
    - The types of questions you will get in these interviews really vary depending on what role you’re applying for. For example, if you’re applying for an Android/iOS role, they might ask you about the design patterns you use when building an app, or the frameworks you use. Some interviews even have you make a simple app/feature or even fix a bug in their codebase. There are so many things that a company can ask you. The main goal in this interview is for the interviewer to see how well you know the technologies you would be using day-to-day.
- Could also be mixed with an algorithmic/data-structures interview
    - Sometimes role-specific questions can be mixed in a coding interview. So you can expect a hybrid interview where you might get asked role-specific questions + data structure/algorithmic questions.
- Some companies have switched to fully doing these types of interviews (e.g. startups)
    - This type of interview has become pretty popular over the years, especially for startups. Some big companies are even doing more of these and are seeing the benefits of this type of interview. BUT, a lot of companies are still doing generalist type of interviews, so you should be able to do well in both types of interviews.

## System Design Interviews

- Usually for experienced hires, not common for interns/new grads
    - You probably won’t encounter this type of interview yet, since y’all are applying to new grad/intern roles. But, you should be aware of these types of interviews since these are asked for mid-senior level roles.
- Understand how well you’re able to design an end-to-end system that is either in/out of your normal domain of expertise
    - The main goal of this type of interview is to get a sense of how well you’re able to architect end-to-end systems given a set of constraints. The interviewer wants to know how both how broad your knowledge is, as well as how in-depth you can go into building components of a system. I won’t spend too much time talking about this type of interview, because you probably won’t encounter this in your interviews. Just be aware that this is on the horizon as you get more experienced.
- Some companies use this to determine level in hiring
    - Some companies use your performance in this interview to gauge your seniority. So, this type of interview is very important to crack as you become more senior.
- Instead, you might be asked an Object-oriented programming (OOP) question

## Extra Tips

- Check [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/member/home/index.htm) interview section is a good resource to go to in order to find out what types of things the company may ask in the interview.
