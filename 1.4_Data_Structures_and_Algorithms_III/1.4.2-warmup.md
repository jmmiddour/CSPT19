### Overview
Remember when we wondered what would happen if multiple keys hashed to the same index, and we said that we would worry about it later? Whelp, it's later ðŸ¤ª.

Let's say we were given the key-value pair `("Ryan", 10)`. Our hash code then maps `"Ryan"` to index `3`. Excellent, that works!

Now let's say after we inserted `("Ryan", 10)`, we have to insert `("Parth", 12)`. Our hash code maps `"Parth"` to index `3`. Uh oh! Ryan is already there! **What do we do??** ðŸ˜±

Ok, let's stop freaking out, and let's think about this. If we don't do anything, the value stored at index `3` will just get overwritten. Meaning if we try to retrieve the value associated with `"Ryan"`, `12` will be returned instead of `10`. That might not seem like a big deal, but what if we were returning passwords based on a user ID, and we returned someone else's password. That would be horrible.

Let's fix this problem. The most common way to solve this is with **linked list chaining**. If we see multiple values hashed to an index, we will chain them in a linked list.

Ok, sounds ideal? But how does this work in code? Let's write some of it together.

### Follow Along
Below is a partially filled out hash table class where we will be using `HashTableEntry` as our `linked list chain` entries.

Take a look at the code below.

    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.next = None

# Hash table can't have fewer than this many slots
MIN_CAPACITY = 8

class HashTable:
    """

    def __init__(self, capacity):

        self.storage = [None] * capacity
        self.item_count = 0

    def get_num_slots(self):
        """

        Implement this.
        """
        # Your code here

    def get_load_factor(self):
        """
        Return the load factor for this hash table.
        Implement this.
        """
        return len(self.storage)

    def djb2(self, key):
        """
        DJB2 hash, 32-bit
        Implement this, and/or FNV-1.
        """
        str_key = str(key).encode()

        hash = FNV_offset_basis_64

        for b in str_key:
            hash *= FNV_prime_64
            hash ^= b
            hash &= 0xffffffffffffffff  # 64-bit hash

        return hash

    def hash_index(self, key):
        """
        Take an arbitrary key and return a valid integer index between within the hash table's storage capacity.
        """
        return self.djb2(key) % self.capacity

    def put(self, key, value):
        """
        Store the value with the given key.

        Implement this.
        """
        # Your code here

    def delete(self, key):
        """
        Remove the value stored with the given key.
        Print a warning if the key is not found.
        Implement this.
        """
        # Your code here

    def get(self, key):
        """
        Retrieve the value stored with the given key.
        Returns None if the key is not found.
        Implement this.
        """
        # Your code here
```

Let's implement the `put` method with `linked list chaining`. **What are the two cases we need to handle?**

1. **There are no entries at the index.** Great! We can make the first entry in the `linked list chain` the key-value pair.
2. **There are multiple entries at the index.** We need to check every entry in the chain. If the key in one of the entries is equal to the key we are passing in, we need to replace it. For instance, let's say we pass in `("Ryan", 12)`, and then we later pass in `("Ryan", 15)`. We would need to replace `"Ryan"`'s old value with `15`. If there are no entries that match, we create a new entry at the end of the chain.

Ok, that might sound confusing. Let's start breaking it down into code.

```
def put(self, key, value):
    """
    Store the value with the given key.
    Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
    Implement this.
    """
    # Your code here
```

First, we need to hash the `key` and start with the first entry at that index.

```
def put(self, key, value):
    """
    Store the value with the given key.
    Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
    Implement this.
    """
    index = self.hash_index(key)

    current_entry = self.storage[index]
```

Next, we need to go through the chain. We need to check two conditions:

1. The current entry is not empty.
2. The key, or the current entry, is not equal to the key we are passing in.

```
def put(self, key, value):
    """
    Store the value with the given key.
    Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
    Implement this.
    """
    index = self.hash_index(key)

    current_entry = self.storage[index]

    while current_entry is not None and current_entry.key != key:
        current_entry = current_entry.next
```

Sweet! Now we need to check what happens when the loop breaks. It would only break for two reasons:

1. We reached an entry with the same key and need to replace the value.
2. We reached the end of the linked list and need to create a new entry.

Let's write that in code!

```
def put(self, key, value):
        """
        Store the value with the given key.
        Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
        Implement this.
        """
        index = self.hash_index(key)

        current_entry = self.storage[index]

        while current_entry is not None and current_entry.key != key:
            current_entry = current_entry.next

        if current_entry is not None:
            current_entry.value = value
        else:
            new_entry = HashTableEntry(key, value)
            new_entry.next = self.storage[index]
            self.storage[index] = new_entry
```

Great! We created the `put` method.

### Overview
What does runtime look like with linked list chaining?

The performance of hash tables for search, insertion, and deletion is constant time (`O(1)`) in the average case. However, as the chains get longer and longer, in the worst case, those same operations are done in linear time (`O(n)`). The more collisions that your hash table has, the less performant the hash table is. `To avoid collisions`, a `proper hash function` and maintaining a `low load factor` is crucial. What is a load factor?

### Load Factor
The load factor of a hash table is trivial to calculate. You take the `number of items` stored in the hash table `divided by the number of slots`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.4_Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_III/images/LoadFactor.jpeg)

`Hash tables use an array for storage`. So, the `load factor` is the `number of occupied slots divided by the length of the array`. So, an array of length 10 with three items in it has a load factor of 0.3, and an array of length 20 with twenty items has a load factor of 1. If you use `linear probing` for `collision resolution`, then the `maximum load factor is 1`. If you use `chaining` for `collision resolution`, then the `load factor can be greater than 1`.

As the load factor of your hash table increases, so does the likelihood of a collision, which reduces your hash table's performance. Therefore, `you need to monitor the load factor` and `resize your hash table` when the `load factor gets too large`. The general rule of thumb is to `resize your hash table` when your `load factor is greater than 0.7`. Also, when you resize, it is `common to double the size` of the hash table. When you resize the array, you need to `re-insert all of the items` into this new hash table. You `cannot` simply `copy the old items` into the new hash table. Each item has to be `rerun through the hashing function` because the hashing function considers the size of the hash table when determining the index that it returns.

You can see that resizing is an expensive operation, so you donâ€™t want to resize too often. However, when we average it out, hash tables are constant time (`O(1)`) even with resizing.

The `load factor` can also be `too small`. If the hash table is too large for the data that it is storing, then memory is being wasted. So, in addition to resizing, when the load factor gets too high, you should also `resize` when the `load factor` gets `too low`.

One way to know when to resize your hash table is to `compute the load factor` whenever an item is `inserted` or `deleted` into the hash table. If the load factor is too high or too low, then you need to resize.

We added a `get_load_factor` and `resize` method to calculate the load factor and resize the hash table with a new capacity when necessary.

### Follow Along
Let's change our `put` method to `resize` when the `load factor` gets `too high`. Here's how our current `put` method looks:

```
def put(self, key, value):
    """
    Store the value with the given key.
    Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
    Implement this.
    """
    index = self.hash_index(key)

    current_entry = self.storage[index]

    while current_entry is not None and current_entry.key != key:
        current_entry = current_entry.next

    if current_entry is not None:
        current_entry.value = value
    else:
        new_entry = HashTableEntry(key, value)
        new_entry.next = self.storage[index]
        self.storage[index] = new_entry
```

To know when to resize, we need to correctly increment the count whenever we insert something new into the hash table. Let's go ahead and add that.

```
def put(self, key, value):
    """
    Store the value with the given key.
    Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
    Implement this.
    """
    index = self.hash_index(key)

    current_entry = self.storage[index]

    while current_entry is not None and current_entry.key != key:
        current_entry = current_entry.next

    if current_entry is not None:
        current_entry.value = value
    else:
        new_entry = HashTableEntry(key, value)
        new_entry.next = self.storage[index]
        self.storage[index] = new_entry

        self.item_count += 1
```

Next, we need to check if the load factor is greater than or equal to 0.7. If it is, we need to double our capacity and resize.

```
def put(self, key, value):
    """
    Store the value with the given key.
    Hash collisions should be handled with Linked List Chaining.
    Implement this.
    """
    index = self.hash_index(key)

    current_entry = self.storage[index]

    while current_entry is not None and current_entry.key != key:
        current_entry = current_entry.next

    if current_entry is not None:
        current_entry.value = value
    else:
        new_entry = HashTableEntry(key, value)
        new_entry.next = self.storage[index]
        self.storage[index] = new_entry

        self.item_count += 1

        if self.get_load_factor() > 0.7:
            self.resize(self.capacity * 2)
```

Fantastic, we did it!

### Challenge
1. Do we need to modify our `delete` and `get` methods to account for the new `get_load_factor` and `resize` methods? 

2. Why or why not?
