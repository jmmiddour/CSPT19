### Intro to Hash Tables
- Problem: Searching for an element in a list is O(n)
- Solution: Hash tables allows for O(1) lookup
- One of the most common data structures
- Key concept: Use a hashing function to get/store/delete values in O(1) time

### Hash Functions
- Takes an input and returns a number
- Main characteristics:
    - Deterministic - same input should always result in the same output
    - Minimal duplication of output values - to minimize collisions, we’ll talk about this in a bit
    - Fast - calculating the hash must be O(1)

### Hash Functions in Hash Tables
- A hash table uses a hash function to get/store/delete values in O(1) time
- A hash table uses a list to store values
- Run the input string/key through the hash function
- Use the modulo operator to get an index within the array bounds
- Get/store/delete the value at that index

### Why is it Called a Hash Function?
> “To hash means to chop something up or to make a mess out of it; the idea in hashing is to scramble some aspects of the key and to use this partial information as the basis for searching.” - Donald Knuth
- We’re scrambling the input string/number/etc and turning it into an index within the underlying list
- We get/store/delete values in that underlying list
- Popular [DJB2 hashing algorithm](https://hackmd.io/26Azl8wVRROLgvoz_OD9GQ)

### [705. Design HashSet](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)

**Problem Description:**

EASY

Design a HashSet without using any built-in hash table libraries.

Implement `MyHashSet` class:

- `add(key)` Inserts the value `key` into the `HashSet`.
- `contains(key)` Returns whether the value `key` exists in the `HashSet` or not.
- `remove(key)` Removes the value `key` in the `HashSet`. If `key` does not exist in the `HashSet`, do nothing.

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["MyHashSet", "add", "add", "contains", "contains", "add", "contains", "remove", "contains"]
[[], [1], [2], [1], [3], [2], [2], [2], [2]]
Output
[null, null, null, true, false, null, true, null, false]

Explanation
MyHashSet myHashSet = new MyHashSet();
myHashSet.add(1);      // set = [1]
myHashSet.add(2);      // set = [1, 2]
myHashSet.contains(1); // return True
myHashSet.contains(3); // return False, (not found)
myHashSet.add(2);      // set = [1, 2]
myHashSet.contains(2); // return True
myHashSet.remove(2);   // set = [1]
myHashSet.contains(2); // return False, (already removed)
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= key <= 10^6`
- At most `10^4` calls will be made to `add`, `remove`, and `contains`.
 

**Follow up:**  
    Could you solve the problem without using the built-in HashSet library?

```

### Hash Table: Average Time Complexities
- Get: O(1)
- Store: O(1)
- Delete: O(1)
- This is amortized/averaged over time. Worst case is actually O(n) and we’ll talk about why

### Collisions
- What happens if you try to store values that have the same index?
- Based on our last example you would overwrite the values!
- How can we solve this?

### Linked List Review
- Comprised of nodes
- Nodes contain: value, next pointer, previous (if doubly linked-list)
- To fully implement a hash table, we’re combining three things: hashing, arrays, linked lists

### Collision Resolution via Chaining
- Operations of a hash table get slower if there are a lot of collisions
- To solve collisions, chain values together by using linked lists
- If a value already exists at that index, add the new item to the linked list
- There are other ways to solve collisions in hash tables. E.g. linear probing 

### [705. Design HashSet](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashset/)

**Problem Description:**

Same problem as above but going to refactor the set to account for collisions

from collections import deque


class MyHashSet:

    def __init__(self):
        """

```

### Load Factor and Resizing
- The performance of a hash table worsens as there are more collisions
    - Can you think of why?
        -
- To prevent this from happening, we need to know when to increase the size of our table
- Use load factor to determine when to expand/shrink
- Load factor = num elements / num slots
    - Expand table if load factor > 0.7
    - Shrink if < 0.2

### Hash Tables Time / Space Complexity
- What’s the time/space complexity of get/store/delete in a degenerately loaded hash table? Perfectly loaded hash table?
- Make sure you can explain why!

  
| | Average | Worst |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Get | O(1) | O(n) |
| Store | O(1) | O(n) |
| Delete | O(1)| O(n) |

### Other Uses of Hash Functions
- Used widely in cryptography
- SHA-256 encryption algorithm
    - Used for the most popular authentication and encryption protocols (SSL, TLS, etc.)
    - Also used in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin
        - Used to verify transactions, create addresses, etc.

### Hash Tables: Things to Know
- There’s many use-cases for hash-tables in programming problems
- Hash-and-store: Use O(1) get/store/delete operations in dictionaries/sets to solve the problem faster, at the expense of additional space
