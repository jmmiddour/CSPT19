### Overview
A dictionary is like a list, but instead of accessing values with an index, you access values with a "key". A "key" can be any type of object (`string`, `number`, `list`, `etc.`). Also, unlike lists, dictionaries do not have an order.

### Follow Along
Let's use a dictionary to create a collection that maps `first names` as `keys` (strings) to `phone numbers` as `values`.

```
phonebook = {} # creates an empty dictionary
phonebook["Abe"] = 4569874321
phonebook["Bill"] = 7659803241
phonebook["Barry"] = 6573214789

print(phonebook)
output ---> {'Abe': 4569874321, 'Bill': 7659803241, 'Barry': 6573214789}
```

Instead of adding one key-value pair at a time, we can initialize the dictionary to have the same values.

```
phonebook = {
    "Abe": 4569874321,
    "Bill": 7659803241,
    "Barry": 6573214789
}

print(phonebook)
output ---> {'Abe': 4569874321, 'Bill': 7659803241, 'Barry': 6573214789}
```

We can iterate over a dictionary as we iterated over a list. We can use the `items()` method, which returns a `tuple` with the `key` and `value` for `each item` in the dictionary.

```
for name, number in phonebook.items():
    print("Name: %s, Number: %s" % (name, number))

OUTPUT:
    Name: Abe, Number: 4569874321
    Name: Bill, Number: 7659803241
    Name: Barry, Number: 6573214789
```

To `remove` a `key-value pair` from a dictionary, you need to use the `del` keyword or use the `pop()` method available on dictionary objects. The difference is `pop()` deletes the item from the dictionary and `returns the value`. When you use the `del` keyword, you've written a statement that `doesn't evaluate to anything`.

```
phonebook = {
    "Abe": 4569874321,
    "Bill": 7659803241,
    "Barry": 6573214789
}

del phonebook["Abe"]

print(phonebook.pop("Bill"))
output ---> 7659803241
```

### Challenge
```
"""
Add "Herb" to the phonebook with the number 7653420789.
Remove "Bill" from the phonebook.
"""
phonebook = {
    "Abe": 4569874321,
    "Bill": 7659803241,
    "Barry": 6573214789,
    "Herb": 7653420789
}

del phonebook['Bill']

# Should print Herb is in the phonebook.
if "Herb" in phonebook:
    print("Herb is in the phonebook.")

# Should print Bill is not in the phonebook.
if "Bill" not in phonebook:
    print("Bill is not in the phonebook.")
```

[Computer Science - Mutability - YouTube](https://youtu.be/zPM_qXV3BwM)

### Overview
In Python, everything is an object.

```
a = 1
b = "hello"
c = [1,2,3]

isinstance(a, object)
output ---> True

isinstance(b, object)
output ---> True

isinstance(c, object)
output ---> True
```

Additionally, all objects in Python have three things:

1. Identity
2. Type
3. Value

```
a = 1
# Identity
id(a)
output ---> 4483164816

# Type
type(a)
output ---> <class 'int'>

# Value
a
output ---> 1
```

### Follow Along
#### Identity
An object's **identity** can never change once it has been created. You can think of an object's identity as its `specific address in memory`. In the code above, `a = 1` created a new object in memory whose identity is represented by the integer `4483164816`.

Python has an `is` operator that allows you to compare two object's identities.

```
a = 1
b = 2

a is b
output ---> False

b = a

a is b
output ---> True
```

In the code above, we first assign `1` to the variable `a`. Then, we assign `2` to the variable `b`. These are two different objects in memory and thus have different identities. We verify that they are different by using the `is` operator, which returns `False`. The line `b = a` assigns the variable `b` the object that the variable `a` is pointed to. Now, both `a` and `b` are referencing the same object in memory. We can use the `id()` function to verify that this is the case as well:

```
id(a)
output ---> 4483164816

id(b)
output ---> 4483164816
```

#### Type
The **type** of an object determines what are its possible values and what operations that object supports. The `type()` function will return what type an object is:

```
a = 'Hello'
type(a)
output ---> <class 'str'>

b = 100
type(b)
output ---> <class 'int'>

c = True
type(c)
output ---> <class 'bool'>
```

Just like an object's identity, once an object is created, its identity can never change. It's an object's type that determines whether an object is **mutable** or **immutable**.

#### Value
The value of some objects can be changed after they are created. The value of some objects cannot be changed after they are created. `If the object's value can be changed`, that object is considered to be `mutable` (changeable). `If the object's value cannot be changed`, that object is considered to be `immutable` (unchangeable).

#### Mutable Objects
A mutable object is an object whose value can be changed after it is created. The word mutable is defined as:

> liable to change

The following types of objects are **mutable**:

- list
- set
- dict
- byte array
- instances of user-defined classes

Let's look at a few examples in code:

#### Lists
```
my_list = ['laughter', 'happiness', 'love']
type(my_list)
output ---> <class 'list'>

my_list[2] = 'joy'
my_list.append('excellent')
my_list
output ---> ['laughter', 'happiness', 'joy', 'excellent'
```

In the first line, we create a list object with three elements and assign it to the variable `my_list`. Then, because `lists are mutable`, we change `'love'` at `index 2` to be `'joy'` instead. We also can grow our list by `appending` a new element to the list.

#### Sets
```
my_set = {'laughter', 'happiness', 'love'}
type(my_set)
output ---> <class 'set'>

my_set.add('happy')
my_set
output ---> {'love', 'happy', 'happiness', 'laughter'}

my_set.remove('happiness')
my_set
output ---> {'love', 'happy', 'laughter'}
```

In the first line, we create a set object with three elements and assign it to the variable `my_set`. Because `set objects are mutable`, we can `add` `'happy'` to the set and `remove` `'happiness'` from the set.

#### Dicts
```
my_dict = {"first_name": "Mattieu", "last_name": "Ricard"}
type(my_dict)
output ---> <class 'dict'>

my_dict["location"] = "Nepal"
my_dict
output ---> {'first_name': 'Mattieu', 'last_name': 'Ricard', 'location': 'Nepal'}

del my_dict['location']
my_dict
output ---> {'first_name': 'Mattieu', 'last_name': 'Ricard'}
```

On line one, we create a `dict` object that has `two key-value pairs`. Then, because `dict objects are mutable`, we add key-value pair `"location": "Nepal"`. Last, we delete that same key-value pair.

Mutable objects work great when you know you will likely need to change the size of the object as you use and interact with it. `Changing mutable objects is cheap` (because you don't have to copy all existing elements to a new object).

#### Aliasing with Mutable Objects
Below, I'm going to walk through what happens when you **alias** a mutable object. In Python, aliasing happens whenever a variable's value is assigned to another variable because variables are just names that store references to values.

Let me illustrate this with a helpful code visualizer tool called [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/1.1.3_fig1.png?token=APLSS6JKLYCA62S5K4QEGVDANAQQC)

On line 1, we instantiate a new list object with three elements (`1`, `2`, and `3`). The name `my_list_orig` is the variable that we assign the new list to.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/1.1.3_fig2.png?token=APLSS6MEUOGTWURACUSQYDLANAQVW)

Then, on line 2, we create an alias of `my_list_orig` by pointing `my_list_alias` to whatever object `my_list_orig` is pointing at. Notice in the image above that there is still only one list object. However, there are two variables in the global frame, and they are both pointing to the same object.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/1.1.3_fig3.png?token=APLSS6IUL4RGRBEYU7IXZCDANAQ4O)

On line 3, we append a new element to `my_list_orig`. Notice that, because both variables are referencing the same object, even though we appended to `my_list_orig`, we also modified `my_list_alias`.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/1.1.3_fig4.png?token=APLSS6OPE5T22XMTZIX4N5DANARDK)

On line 4, we `removed` the element `1` from `my_list_orig`. Notice, just like when we added to the list, `my_list_alias` is also affected.

*This behavior is something you need to be aware of if you ever use aliasing with mutable objects in your code.*

#### Immutable Objects
An immutable object is an object whose value cannot be changed after it is created. `Immutable` means `not changeable`. Anytime you try to update the value of an immutable object, `a new object is created instead`.

The following types are immutable:

- Numbers (int, float, complex)
- Strings
- Bytes
- Booleans
- Tuples

Immutable objects are useful when you want to make sure that the object you created will always maintain the same value. `Immutable objects are more expensive to change` (in terms of time and space complexity) because `changing the object requires making a copy` of the existing object.

Let's look at a few examples:

#### Numbers
```
my_int = 1
id(my_int)
output ---> 4513307280

type(my_int)
output ---> <class 'int'>

my_int
output ---> 1

my_int = 2
id(my_int)
output ---> 4513307312

type(my_int)
output ---> <class 'int'>

my_int
output ---> 2
```

In the code above, the first line creates a new `int` object, and the variable `my_int` now points at that object. You can see that this object has `int` for its `type`, `4513307280` for its `identity` (location in memory), and `1` for its `value`.

Then, we assign `2` to `my_int` which creates a whole new object and assigns it to the variable `my_int`. This object has `int` for its `type`, `4513307312` for its `identity` (which you can see is different from the first object), and `2` for its `value`.

#### Strings
Let's look at how string concatenation works in Python. Remember that str objects are immutable.

```
my_str = 'a'
type(my_str)
output ---> <class 'str'>

id(my_str)
output ---> 140716674193840

my_str
output ---> 'a'

my_str += 'b'
type(my_str)
output ---> <class 'str'>

id(my_str)
output ---> 140716674658992

my_str
output ---> 'ab'
```

So, on line 1, we create a string object with the value `'a'` and assign it to the variable `my_str`. We verify that the object is of `type str`, we print its `identity (140716674193840)` and print its `value`.

Then, we concatenate `'b'` onto the existing string with the line `my_str += 'b'`. Now, because string objects are immutable, we cannot change a string object's value after it has been created. To `concatenate`, we create a new string object and assign the value `'ab'` to that object.

This behavior in Python is vital to be aware of when working with string concatenation. If you have to add and remove frequently from a string, this will be inefficient if you work with string objects directly.

#### Tuples
Tuples are an `immutable container of names`, where each name has an `unchangeable` (`immutable`) `binding` to an object in memory. You `cannot change the bindings` of the names to the objects.

```
my_tuple = ('love', [1,2,3], True)
my_tuple[0]
output ---> 'love'

my_tuple[0] = 'laughter'
OUTPUT:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

Here we created a tuple using `(` and `)` to denote the `tuple literal syntax`. Just like a list, tuples `can contain elements of any type`. Above, we've included a `string`, a `list`, and a `boolean` as our tuple elements. We are proving the tuple object's immutability by showing the error that occurs when trying to assign a new item to a position in the tuple.

One thing that often causes confusion surrounding the immutability of tuples in Python is demonstrated by the following behavior:

```
my_tuple[1] = [4,5,6]
OUTPUT:
  Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment

id(my_tuple[1])
OUTPUT ---> 140716674620864

my_tuple[1][0] = 4
my_tuple[1][1] = 5
my_tuple[1][2] = 6
my_tuple[1]
OUTPUT ---> [4, 5, 6]

my_tuple
OUTPUT ---> ('love', [4, 5, 6], True)

id(my_tuple[1])
OUTPUT ---> 140716674620864
```

Notice that we cannot create a new list object and bind it to the name at position 1 of our tuple. This is demonstrated when `my_tuple[1] = [4,5,6]` raises a `TypeError`. However, we can assign new objects to the list that is at position 1 of our tuple? Why is that? Well, what do we know about lists in Python? `Lists are mutable` objects. So, we can `modify a list without creating a new object`. So, when we are modifying the list directly (instead of assigning a new object), it doesn't affect our tuple's immutability. Notice that the identity (`140716674620864`) of the list at `my_tuple[1]` doesn't change after replacing its three elements with `4`, `5`, and `6`.

#### Passing Objects to Functions
Mutable and immutable objects are not treated the same when they are passed as arguments to functions. When `mutable` objects are passed into a function, they are `passed by reference`. So, suppose you change the mutable object that was passed in as an argument. In that case, you are changing the original object as well.

#### Mutable Objects as Arguments

```
my_list = [1,2,3]
def append_num_to_list(lst, num):
    lst.append(num)

    append_num_to_list(my_list, 4)
    my_list
OUTPUT ---> [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/mutable-object-passed-as-argument-to-function.gif?token=APLSS6NSGBVOP3I4O4OWINDANKQE2)

Notice that when `append_num_to_list` is called and `my_list` is passed in as an argument. When `my_list` is bound to `lst` in that stack frame, `lst` points to the original `my_list` in memory. The function call did not create a copy of `my_list`. This behavior is because `lists are mutable` objects in Python.

#### Immutable Objects as Arguments
Next, let's see how Python behaves when we pass an immutable object as an argument to a function:

```
my_string = "I am an immutable object."
def concatenate_string_to_string(orig_string, string_to_add):
    return orig_string + string_to_add

concatenate_string_to_string(my_string, " I hope!")
OUTPUT ---> 'I am an immutable object. I hope!'

my_string
OUTPUT ---> 'I am an immutable object.'
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/immutable-object-passed-argument-to-function.gif?token=APLSS6OTLQCYU3WKLTQZ7CDANKREY)

Notice when an `immutabl` object is passed into a function, the object is copied and bound to the parameter name. In the example above, when `my_string` is passed into `concatenate_string_to_string`, `my_string` is `copied` to a `new object bound to` the name `orig_string`.

### Overview
#### What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task. Within this broad definition, we could call every piece of code an algorithm.

#### How do we measure how "good" an algorithm is?
After coming up with a first-pass solution to a problem, we need to measure how "good" our answer is. Will it stand up to the test of millions of users? Is it fast enough that our users will be blown away by how quickly they get their results? Or will tortuously slow speeds cause lag that scares them all away?

When given a choice between different algorithms, we want to choose the most efficient algorithm (considering both time and space efficiency depending on our needs).

**Note:**  
*It is common for your first solution to work with a few items or users and break as you add more. Making sure that the solutions scale is something all developers must look out for.*

#### What is Big O notation?
We need a way to talk about efficiency (number of operations in the worst case) in a more general sense.

Big O notation is the language we use for describing `how efficient an algorithm is`.

The specific terms of Big O notation describe `how fast the runtime grows` (relative to the input size), focusing on when the input gets extremely large.

**Why do we focus on the growth of runtime versus exact runtime?**   
The actual runtime depends on the specific computer running the algorithm, so we cannot compare efficiencies that way. By focusing on the general growth, we can avoid exact runtime differences between machines and environments.

We also talk about runtime relative to the input size because we need to express our speed in terms of something. So we show the speed of the algorithm in terms of the input size. That way, we can see how the speed reacts as the input size grows.

We don't care about speed when the input size is small. The differences in speed are likely to be minimal when the input size is small. When the input size gets enormous, we can see the differences in efficiency between algorithms.

#### Common Big O run times
Refer to the table below to see a list of the most common runtimes. The table is ordered from fastest to slowest.

| Classification | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Constant `O(1)` | The runtime is entirely unaffected by the input size. This is the ideal solution.|
| Logarithmic `O(log n)` | As the input size increases, the runtime will grow slightly slower. This is a pretty good solution. |
| Linear `O(n)` | As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at the same rate. This is a pretty good solution. |
| Polynomial `O(n^c)` | As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at a faster rate. This might work for small inputs but is not a scalable solution. |
| Exponential `O(c^n)` | As the input size increases, the runtime will grow at a much faster rate. This solution is inefficient. |
| Factorial `O(n!)` | As the input size increases, the runtime will grow astronomically, even with relatively small inputs. This solution is exceptionally inefficient. |

Besides the table, it's also essential to look at the curves of these different runtimes.

![Time Complexity Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/time_complexity_chart.png?token=APLSS6KF6MQHC4SNG4QUOGTANM7SW)

Again, `n` represents the size of the data, and on the chart above, `N` represents the number of operations. This visualization should help illustrate why `O(1)` or `O(log n)` is the most desirable.

**Note:**
*Big O only matters for large data sets. An `O(n^3)` solution is adequate, as long as you can guarantee that your datasets will always be small.*

#### A few examples
Let's look at a few different examples of Python functions that print something to the output. For each of these, the input will be `items`.

#### Constant Time `O(1)`
```
def print_only_one_thing(list_of_things):
    print(list_of_things[0])
```

Why is this constant time? Because no matter how large or small the input is (1,000,000 or 10), the number of computations within the function is the same.

#### Linear Time `O(n)`
```
def print_list(list_of_things):
    for thing in list_of_things:
        print(thing)
```

Why is this classified as linear time? Because the speed of the algorithm increases at the same rate as the input size. If `list_of_things` has ten items, then the function will print ten times. If it has 10,000 items, then the function will print 10,000 times.

#### Quadratic Time `O(n^2)`
```
def print_permutations(list_of_things):
    for thing_one in list_of_things:
        for thing_two in list_of_things:
            print(thing_one, thing_two)
```

Why is this quadratic time? The clue is the `nested for loops`. These nested for loops mean that for each item in `list_of_things` (the `outer` loop), we iterate through every item in `list_of_things` (the `inner` loop). For an input size of `n`, we have to print `n * n` times or `n^2` times.

#### What are we supposed to do with the constants?
What if we had a function like this?

```
def do_a_bunch_of_stuff(list_of_things): # O(1 + n/2 + 2000)
    last_idx = len(list_of_things) - 1
    print(list_of_things[last_idx]) # O(1)

    middle_idx = len(list_of_things) / 2
    idx = 0
    while idx < middle_idx: # O(n/2)
        print(list_of_things[idx])
        idx = idx + 1

    for num in range(2000): # O(2000)
        print(num)
```

`print(items[last_idx])` is `constant time` because it doesn't change as the input changes. So that portion of the function is `O(1)`.

The `while loop` that prints up to the middle index is 1/2 of whatever the input size is; we can say that portion of the function is `O(n/2)`.

The `final portion` will run `2000 times`, no matter the size of the input.

So, putting it all together, we could say that the efficiency is `O(1 + n/2 + 2000)`. However, we don't say this. We describe this function as having `linear time O(n)` because we drop all of the constants. Why do we cut all of the constants? Because as the input size gets huge, adding 2000 or dividing by 2 has minimal effect on the algorithm's performance.

#### Most significant term
Let's consider the following function:

```
def do_different_things_in_the_same_function(list_of_things): # O(n + n^2)
    # print all each item in the list
    for thing in list_of_things: # O(n)
        print(thing)

    # print every possible pair of things in the list
    for thing_one in list_of_things: # O(n * n) = O(n^2)
        for thing_two in list_of_things:
            print(thing_one, thing_two)
```

We could describe this function as `O(n + n^2)`; however, we only need to keep the essential term, `n^2`, so this would be `O(n^2)`. Why can we do this? Because as the input size (`n`) gets larger and larger, the less significant terms have less effect, and only the most significant term is important.

#### Big O represents the worst-case
Let's consider the following function:

```
def find_thing(list_of_things, thing_we_are_trying_to_find):
    for thing in list_of_things:
        if thing == thing_we_are_trying_to_find:
            return True

    return False
```

What would the result be if it just so happens that the `thing_we_are_trying_to_find` in `list_of_things` is the very first item in the list? The function would only have to look at one item in `list_of_things` before returning. In this case, it would be `O(1)`. But, when we talk about a `function's complexity`, we usually assume the `"worst case."` What would the "worst-case" be? It would be if it were the last item in `list_of_things`. In that case, we would have to look through all the `list_of_things`, and that complexity would be `O(n)`.

**Note:** 
*When talking about runtime complexity in casual conversation, engineers often blur the distinction between `big theta` and `big O` notation. In reality, these are two distinct ways of describing an algorithm. `Big theta` gives both an `upper` and a `lower bound` for the running time. `Big O` only provides an `upper bound`. Refer to the following articles for a deeper dive: [Big-Theta notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/big-big-theta-notation) and [Big-O notation](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/asymptotic-notation/a/big-o-notation).*

#### Do constants ever matter?
Complexity analysis with Big O notation is a valuable tool. It would be best if you got in the habit of thinking about the efficiency of the algorithms you write and use in your code. However, just because two algorithms have the same Big O notation doesn't mean they are equal.

Imagine you have a script that takes 1 hour to run. By improving the function, you can divide that runtime by six, and now it only takes 10 minutes to run. With Big O notation, `O(n)` and `O(n/6)` can both be `written as O(n)`, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth optimizing the script to save 50 minutes every time the script runs.

That being said, there is a term you should become familiar with: **premature optimization** ([xkcd: Optimization](https://xkcd.com/1691/)). Sometimes, you can sacrifice readability or spend too much time on something to improve its efficiency. Depending on the situation, it could be that having a finished product to iterate on is more important than maximally efficient code. It is your job as a developer to know when making your code more efficient is necessary. You will always be making calculated tradeoffs between runtime, memory, development time, readability, and maintainability. It takes time to develop the wisdom to strike the right balance depending on the scenario.

![Premature Optimization Comic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/premature_optimization.png?token=APLSS6IS6HA4VVHWRARX6HDANNDFY)

### Follow Along
Let's look at a few code snippets and classify their runtime complexity using Big O notation.

```
def foo(n):
    i = 1
    while i < n:
        print(i)
        i *= 2
```

First, let's think about what the above function is doing. It's printing `i`…but `i` is not being incremented by `1`, as we usually see. It's doubled every time we run the loop. So, for example, if `n = 100`, then the final result would be…

```
1
2
4
8
16
32
64
```

Or if `n = 10`, then we would print…

```
1
2
4
8
```

We can use the process of elimination to narrow down which runtime classification makes sense for this algorithm. The number of times the loop runs seems to vary based on the value of `n`, so this is `NOT O(1)`.

From the above examples, we can also see that the number of times the loop runs is increasing slower than the input size is increasing. `n` must be *doubled* before the loop will run one more time. We can `eliminate` classifications such as `O(n log n)`, `O(n^c)`, `O(c^n)`, and `O(n!)`.

The only two options left at this point are `logarithmic` and `linear`. Since the two growth rates (input, the number of operations) are `not the same`, this function must run in `logarithmic time`!

### Overview
We often want to compare an algorithm's time complexity (how efficiently the number of operations grows as the input size increases). Similarly, we also want to compare the space complexity of an algorithm.

Talking about space complexity is very similar to talking about time complexity. Except with **space complexity**, we are looking at the **efficiency of memory usage instead of the number of operations**.

Often, it isn't easy to optimize for time and space at the same time. For instance, by increasing time efficiency, you may need to use more memory and decrease space complexity. This is not always the case, but you have to decide if you are optimizing for space or time complexity because of this.

### Follow Along
This function takes `O(1)` space:

```
def print_something_a_certain_number_of_times(thing_to_print, number_of_times):
    for i in range(number_of_times):
        print(thing_to_print)
```

The function above has a `constant (O(1))` `space` complexity because no matter how large `n` gets, the `amount of memory` being used `stays the same`.

This function takes `O(n)` space:

```
def append_to_list_a_certain_number_of_times(number_of_times):
    # create an empty list
    my_list = []

    # append to the list the number of times specified by the caller
    for _ in range(n):
        my_list.append("lambda")

    return my_list
```

We are often referring to *additional* space when we talk about space complexity–meaning that we do not include the memory used by the inputs.

This function takes constant space (`O(1)`) even though the input has `n` items:

```
def get_the_max(items_list):
    maximum = float("-inf")
    for item in items_list:
        if item > maximum:
            maximum = item

    return maximum
```

### Overview
List comprehensions are a potent tool. With a list comprehension, you can `create a new list based on another list in a single, highly readable line`.

The format of a list comprehension follows this syntax:

`[<map expression> for <name> in <sequence expression> if <filter expression>]`

### Follow Along
If you are using a `for` loop to map a list onto a new list or filter an existing list, a list comprehension can be a better option.

Here is an example of replacing a `for` loop used to map `word lengths` with a single line with a list comprehension.

```
sentence = "Every moment is a fresh beginning."
words = sentence.split()
word_lengths = []

# Using a for loop
for word in words:
    word_lengths.append(len(word))

print(words)        # ['Every', 'moment', 'is', 'a', 'fresh', 'beginning.']
print(word_lengths) # [5, 6, 2, 1, 5, 10]

# Using a list comprehension
word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words]

print(word_lengths) # [5, 6, 2, 1, 5, 10]
```

Here is an example of replacing a `for` loop used to `filter out odd numbers` from a list with a list comprehension.

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_numbers = []

# Using a for loop
for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        even_numbers.append(number)

print(even_numbers) # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# Using a list comprehension
even_numbers = [number for number in numbers if number % 2 == 0]

print(even_numbers) # [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

You can also write a list comprehension that `maps and filters simultaneously`. Let's go back to our sentence example and only track `word lengths` that are `greater than 2`.

```
sentence = "Every moment is a fresh beginning."
words = sentence.split()
word_lengths = []

# Using a for loop
for word in words:
    if len(word) > 2:
        word_lengths.append(len(word))

print(words)        # ['Every', 'moment', 'is', 'a', 'fresh', 'beginning.']
print(word_lengths) # [5, 6, 5, 10]

# Using a list comprehension
word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words if len(word) > 2]

print(word_lengths) # [5, 6, 5, 10]
```
