# CSPT19 Sprint 1 - Computer Science Fundamentals 

## Module 3 - Space and Time Compleity

* [Slides for the Lecture]()

* [Lecture with Mari Batilando]()

* Always take into account the worse case scenario when calculating time and space complexity.

### Constant Time and Space:
* The runtime/space of our function doesn't change with respect to our input.

* It stays constant.

* Writen as `O(1)`

Example:
```
def doComplicatedFunction(
```

### Linear Time and Space

* The runtime/space of our function increases linearly as our input size grows.

* Writen as `O(n)` 
    - `n` is the length of some list in time.
    - `n` is the 
    
### Logarithmic Time and Space

* The runtime/space of our function grows logarithmically with respect to the input size.

* Writen as `O(log n)`

### Quadratic Time and Space

* The runtime/space of our function increases quadratically 

### Exponential Time and Space

* The runtime/space of our function increases exponentially as our input size grows
