#### Overview:
- To get started writing Python, you need to be able to use the Python interpreter. There are essentially two primary approaches:

    1. Install Python on your local machine.

    2. Use a website that allows you to access the Python interpreter online.

- Below, we will walk through how to install Python for your specific OS and refer to some preferred websites that give you access to the interpreter online.

#### Follow Along:
- **Windows**
    - Windows machines usually do not ship with Python installed. Installing on Windows is pretty simple.

        1. Download the latest Python 3 Installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) (make sure you pay attention to 32-bit vs. 64-bit and select the right one for your machine).
        2. Run the installer and **make sure you check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" to ensure that you place the interpreter in your execution path**.

##### Online Interpreters:
- Here are a few websites that give you online access to the Python interpreter:

    - [Repl.it](https://repl.it/)
    - [Trinket](https://trinket.io/)
    - [Python Fiddle](http://pythonfiddle.com/)
    - [Python.org Online Console](https://www.python.org/shell)
    - [Python Anywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)

#### Challenge
Before doing anything else, you should now follow the instructions above (those that apply to your OS) and make sure you have a working installation of Python on your machine.

#### Overview

Many times, both as you are working through the Computer Science curriculum and when you are on the job, you will find yourself faced with large, challenging problems. There are strategies we can use to break these problems down into more manageable pieces.

> "The single most important skill for a computer scientist is problem-solving. Problem-solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem-solving skills."  
> Think Python, 2nd Edition, by Allen B. Downey (O’Reilly).  
> Copyright 2016 Allen Downey, 978-1-4919-3936-9.

Every problem, large or small, can be broken into smaller chunks. Logically, if you can take a seemingly unsolvable problem and break it into smaller, more manageable chunks, once you've finished solving each piece of the problem, you'll have conquered the whole thing!

Throughout the Computer Science curriculum, we will reference and draw from the Lambda Problem Solving Framework, sometimes referred to as UPER. This framework is a step-by-step process:

1. **U**nderstand
2. **P**lan
3. **E**xecute
4. **R**eflect

Almost all problems are a series of sub-problems. You will use the steps of **U.P.E.R** on the primary outer problem and the inner, individual sub-problems.

- #### Understand
    Before doing anything else, make sure you understand precisely what the problem is asking. A helpful starting point could be transcribing the technical description of the problem into your own words.
    
    ##### Questions
    Here is a list of starter questions that might come up during this step:
    
    - What are the inputs your code receives?
        - What is the range of the input?
        - How big can the input be (how much data)?
        
    - What are the outputs your code produces?
        - What is the range of the output?
        - How big can the output be (how much data)?
    - How performant must the code be?
    - Is there anything missing from the task description that needs to be clarified?
    - What assumptions are you making?
        - Does anyone else on the team need to validate these assumptions?
        
    ##### Actions
    The most important thing you can **do** during this stage of the process is to **ask questions**! Be as specific as you can when you ask questions. Be clear and concise with your questions by using unambiguous language and only including necessary details.
    
    Don't be afraid of this part of the process—enjoy it! Look at the problem as a curiosity to be explored, not just something there to torment you. Feeling frustrated and afraid won’t help you at work or in an interview. Remember, problem-solving is the fun part, so enjoy it!
    
    One approach is to identify the smaller components that make up the larger problem. If you get stuck in understanding, break the larger problem into smaller sub-problems. Then, apply this framework against each of the smaller sub-problems until you solve the larger problem.
    
    - Try to digest the problem and comprehend it by rewriting the problem in your own words. If you had to describe it to someone else, how would you do it?
    
    - Diagram how the data flows through the problem. Think about each stage of the journey for the data. What will happen to it as it travels from one step to another?
    
    - Think like a villain. What inputs would break your program?
    
    - Where is the description of the problem incomplete? If you cannot get answers on something that the specifications leave unclear, make an educated guess, and document your assumptions and decision.
    
    You are done with this step when you can explain this problem to someone who has never seen it. Your explanation should be thorough enough for the person to skip the "Understand" step and start planning right away.

- #### Plan
    This step is where you will ask, *"What steps will I take to solve the problem?"* 
    - You will take your description of the problem and transform it into a complete, actionable plan to solve that problem. If you realize you still don't truly understand the problem while planning, return to **Understand** until you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed **Understand**, you will end up planning to solve the wrong problem! When interviewing, you must do this step aloud!
    
    - Remember, you are not coding during this step unless it’s a small piece of throwaway code to test a hypothesis. It would be best if you wrote pseudocode during this step, however.
    
    ##### Questions
    - Do you know the answer to a similar problem that has comparable inputs and outputs?
        - Does this problem remind you an anything else?
        - Can you bring that knowledge to bear here?
        
    - Does my plan meet the performance requirements?
        - What’s the time complexity?
        - What’s the space complexity?
        - How big can my input data be?
      
    - Can sorting the input data ahead of time lead to any improvements in time complexity?
        - Does recursion help?
        - Is the problem made up of identical sub-problems?
        - Can you state the problem with itself in its definition?
      
    - Think like a villain. Does your plan cover the edge cases?
    
    ##### Actions
    - Solve the problem like a human. If you’re sorting something, imagine your task as a pile of blocks that you need to sort by hand. Break down the steps you take into small enough pieces for a computer to understand. Approach the problem from many angles.

    - Get a brute-force solution as quickly as possible. Even if it’s not performant enough, it can lead you toward better solutions.

    - Come up with as many plans of attack as you can. Choose the best one that satisfies performance needs.
  
    - Try to solve a simpler version of the problem. 
        - If the input is a 2D array, can you solve it for a 1D array? 
            - If you need to count the number of ways to eat cookies 1, 2, or 3 at a time, first try to solve it for the number of ways you could eat two at a time, or even one at a time. 
            - The solution to the more straightforward problem can lead to insights on the more complex problem.
        
    - List the nouns and verbs in the problem description. Map each one to an algorithm, process, data structure, object, method, function, etc.
    
    - **"Perfect" can be the enemy of "good."** 
      - Even if your initial workable solution isn’t performant enough, you can iterate later.
      - **“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”**
    
    - You know that you completed this step when you have pseudocode that’s detailed enough to convert to real code. It would be best if you also were convinced the pseudocode represents a legitimate working solution.

- #### Execute
    This step is where you take your plan and convert it to actual working code. This step isn’t easy, but it’s much easier if you've done an excellent job with the "Understand" and "Plan" steps above. If you find shortcomings in your plan while implementing the solution, return to the "Plan" phase until you resolve the ambiguity. If you have not yet completed the "Plan" step, you will spend far longer on the "Execute" step than you have to.
    
    ##### Questions
    - Think like a villain. Does your implementation handle all inputs?
    - What is the best way to split this code into separate functions or classes?
    - Does this functionality already exist?
        - Are there built-in libraries I can leverage?
        - Are there third-party libraries I can leverage?
    ##### Actions
    - Convert your pseudocode and outlines into actual code. **Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)**: Remove redundant code as you write it.
    
    - Document code as you write it. Header blocks should contain information on how someone should use the code. Comment only when necessary; where possible, write code clearly enough that comments aren’t needed. If comments help clarify or summarize a piece of code to a reader, definitely add comments.
    
    - If you write code that’s hackish or kludgy, fix it. If you don’t have time to fix it, comment it, explain why you couldn’t do it "the right way" (time constraints, etc.), and what you need to do to make it right.
    
    - You know this step is complete when your solution works on good data, it doesn't fail on flawed data or edge cases, and the program passes all of the tests.

- #### Reflect
    The primary question you are dealing with during this step is — "is this implementation as good as I can make it?" Would I be proud to show my code to another programmer?
    
    ##### Questions
    - Does your solution work in all cases?
        - Main case?
        - Edge cases?
        
    - Is the solution performant enough?
      
    - Is the code documented?
      
    - In retrospect, what would you do differently? What will you do differently next time?
        - What went right?
        - What went wrong?
    
    ##### Actions
    Adding documentation is a necessary action during this step. It would be best if you documented any future changes you plan on making. You should document any code sections that you will need to make more performant if the data size increases.
    
    Another critical action to take during this step is to remove any redundant or unnecessary code. Also, depending on your time constraints, it's likely that you might have some hackish code that you'd like to improve in the future when time allows. Make sure to document any ideas or plans on how you might do so.
    
    You know that this step is complete when your code is adequately refactored and exhaustively documented.

#### Follow Along
Let’s use the [dining philosophers problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem) as an example problem to use our Problem Solving Framework on. Here's a short description of the problem:

>Five silent philosophers sit at a round table with bowls of noodles. One chopstick is placed between each pair of adjacent philosophers.

> Each philosopher must alternately think and eat. However, a philosopher can only eat noodles when they have both left and right chopsticks. Each chopstick can be held by only one philosopher and so a philosopher can use the chopstick only if it is not being used by another philosopher. After an individual philosopher finishes eating, they need to put down both chopsticks so that the chopsticks become available to others. A philosopher can take the chopstick on their right or the one on their left as they become available, but cannot start eating before getting both chopsticks.

> Eating is not limited by the remaining amounts of noodles or stomach space; an infinite supply and an infinite demand are assumed.

> The problem is how to design a discipline of behavior (a concurrent algorithm) such that no philosopher will starve; i.e. each can forever continue to alternate between eating and thinking, assuming that no philosopher can know when others may want to eat or think.

- #### Understand
    On the surface, this seems like a straightforward problem — however, some approaches will lead to problematic results.
    
    - Here are some critical pieces of information from the question we should highlight:
    
        - there are **5** philosophers
        - there are **2 states** (eating, thinking)
        - there is precisely 1 chopstick in between each pair of philosophers (5 total)
        - BOTH chopsticks are required to transition from thinking to eating
    
    - Some essential questions to ask here include:
        - "When should philosophers pick up a chopstick?"
        - "When should philosophers put down a chopstick?"
    
    Remember that you want to establish if there are any restrictions or limitations you need to consider before you work on a solution.

- #### Plan
    Let’s create a solution written as a set of rules that defines how philosophers should interact with chopsticks in a manner that will allow them to transition between *eating* and *thinking*.
    
    1. philosopher is eating (2 chopsticks)
       
    2. philosopher finishes eating and sets down chopsticks
       
    3. philosopher is thinking (0 chopsticks)
       
    4. philosopher sees his/her neighbor set down chopsticks & picks them up
       
    5. repeat steps 1-4
       
- #### Execute
    We could break down the general plan above into a few specific rules.
    
    - eat for a set amount of time once they are holding both chopsticks
    
    - put down the right chopstick
    
    - put down the left chopstick
    
    - pick up the left chopstick as soon as it becomes available
    
    - pick up the right chopstick as soon as it becomes available
    
    - repeat
    
    However, this solution will NOT always work.

- #### Reflect
    The above solution has the potential to create a situation known in Computer Science as **deadlock**. A deadlock means that two processes are stuck in an eternal state of waiting. If neither has two chopsticks, they cannot eat. But they also won’t put down chopsticks they’re holding (because they haven’t eaten yet). We need to revise the rules about when philosophers should pick up / put down chopsticks to eliminate this possibility.

#### Challenge
For everyone to eat, there are some situations in which philosophers *should* pick up a chopstick and some cases in which they *should NOT* (because another philosopher needs to use it).

Write a better solution to the dining philosophers problem so that deadlock does NOT occur.

#### Overview
The necessary action when asking a question is to imagine that you are trying to answer your question. Because you are deep in your problem's weeds, it's easy to forget that the person who answers your question does not have all the context. We should keep this general rule in mind — it's the overarching rule for all the details we go into next.

- #### Search and Research
    Before you do anything else, search for a solution to your problem on your own. One thing you should start doing is keeping track of all your research when solving a problem. One easy way to do this is to have a browser window represent a specific search for a solution, and each open tab represents an attempt at solving it. Keeping track of your research is vital because it's helpful to provide examples of similar questions or similar problems and explain why those didn't answer your specific problem or question. It also helps the person answering your question avoid pointing you toward resources you've already explored, and lets them know that you've already put in the work.

- #### Introduce the Problem
    The first thing you do when you ask a question is to introduce the problem. The first paragraph of your written question should serve as an executive summary of the problem. All the following paragraphs should fill in the details of the problem.
    
    An important thing to include in your problem introduction is a precise explanation of how you encountered the problem. Write about the difficulties that kept you from solving it. Describe what you already tried and include the results of the research you've done.
    
    You should also provide as much detail about the context as possible. For instance, include the language version, the platform version, the operating system, the database type, specific IDE, and any web server information. You should also include your particular constraints. For example, you may not be allowed to use feature A or B that would provide an obvious solution. If you have an odd constraint, it may also help explain why you have that constraint.

- #### Help Others Reproduce the Problem
    One thing to remember is that not all questions benefit from including code. However, if you include code, definitely do not just copy in your entire program! By having irrelevant details, you make your question much harder to answer and decrease the chances of someone helping you.

    Here are some guidelines for when to include code in your question.

    - ##### Minimal
        Include just enough code to allow others to reproduce your specific problem. One way to do this is to restart from scratch. Do not include snippets of your entire program. Instead, create a new program, but only add what's necessary to recreate the problem.
    
        If you aren't exactly sure where the problem code is, one way to find it is by removing code chunks one at a time until the problem disappears — then add back the last part. This way, you can deduce that the last piece of code you added back is likely the source of your problem.
    
        Be careful not to remove too much code, either. Keep your question brief, but maintain enough context for clarity.
    
    - ##### Complete
        Make sure you include all the portions of the code needed to reproduce the problem. It would be best if you assumed that the person who is answering your question would not write any code to reproduce your issue. Again, remember, do not use images of code—those trying to help you need direct access to the code you include in your question.
    
    - ##### Reproducible
        When you include your code, it's also important to tell the reader exactly what you expect the behavior to be. Be sure to show the reader the exact wording of the error message you encountered (if there was one). It's also crucial to double-check that your included example reproduces the problem.
    
        One other thing you can do is create a live example on a site like sqlfiddle.com or jsbin.com. If you do, make sure you also include a copy of your code in your question. Not everyone will utilize the link to the live example.
    
        And to reiterate, do not post images of any code, data, or error messages—reserve images for things like rendering bugs—things that are impossible to describe accurately with just text.

    - ##### Proofread
        Don't send a question you haven't proofread. When you post your question, you should have already read and reread it, taking care to follow all the best practices and making sure your question makes sense. It would be best if you imagined that you're coming to your question fresh, with no other context but the question itself. You want to make your question as easy for someone to answer as possible. Remember, the reader is likely choosing between several questions they could answer. You want your question to stand out as something concise and approachable. Don't forget to double-check your spelling, grammar, and formatting. Keep it as straightforward as you can; you're not writing a novel.
    
    - ##### Respond to Feedback
        As feedback and responses to your question begin coming in, respond as quickly as possible. You'll likely receive clarifying questions, and your readers need that clarification to help you.

#### Follow Along
Now let's look at an example of a question posted to Stack Overflow and analyze it to see if it follows the best practices outlined above.

- [Look at this Question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/522563/accessing-the-index-in-for-loops)

    ![Example Help Question](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmmiddour/CSPT19/main/1.1_Computer_Science_Fundamentals/images/1.1.1.3_example_help_question.jpg)  
  
    - The first thing to notice is that the post has a short but descriptive title that adequately summarizes the question.  

        > Accessing the index in 'for' loops?
    
    - Next, did the questioner provide any additional context or proof of the research they've done so far? 
        - It doesn't look like it. They could improve the question by including what they tried, and the resources they explored.  
    
    - The questioner did an excellent job of introducing the question and including code that shows what they are trying to do. 
        - In this case, they did not need to include experience vs. expected behavior; they just needed to have the expected behavior. By clearly stating what the desired result was, it helped the person answering to respond appropriately.  
    
    - The code they included is a minimal and complete example, allowing someone to reproduce the problem quickly. 
        - The questioner left out irrelevant details and code that would've distracted from the primary question.  
        - They also included an example of what the desired output would be, which is helpful.  
    
    - It appears the questioner proofread their question beforehand as it does not contain any glaring spelling, grammar, or formatting problems. However, we could critique this example for including a redundant sentence at the end. Instead of including that sentence, they might have rephrased the first sentence of the question to be more precise.

#### Challenge
1. Choose a real-world example from a recent problem/challenge. Use the guidelines and process outlined above to ask for help in your cohort-specific help channel.  
2. Identify an unanswered question in your cohort-specific help channel. Do your best to provide a helpful response to that question.  
3. Find an example of a **bad** question on Stack Overflow. Analyze the question using the guidelines above and write a short response explaining *why* you believe it is a **bad** question.  
4. Find an example of a **good** question on Stack Overflow. Analyze the question using the guidelines above and write a short response explaining *why* you believe it is a **good** question.

### [Objective 04](https://lambdaschool.instructure.com/courses/932/pages/objective-04-use-a-print-statement?module_item_id=557571)

Learning to use the `print` function in Python is the perfect way to start writing Python code. When learning to write in any new programming language, one of the first things you want to do is get some *output* from your program. The `print` function is how you output the value of an object to the screen. You will learn how to use the `print` function in Python.

#### Follow Along
##### Using `print` with different objects
Let's start by executing the `print` function to print different types of objects in Python. There are numerous types of objects that you can `print` using the print function.

Using `print` with no arguments:

```
print()  
output:  
```  

- Notice the empty line after calling the `print` function. The default `end` value when calling print is the newline character `\n`.  

Using `print` with a string literal:

```
print("Lambda School is awesome!")

>>> output: Lambda School is awesome!
```

- Notice how calling `print` with the string literal printed the exact string we passed in onto the screen.

Using `print` with a variable:

```
slogan = "i love lamp"
print(slogan)

>>> output: i love lamp
```

- Notice how calling `print` with the `slogan` variable prints the value assigned to the `slogan` variable.

Using `print` with an expression:

```
superlative = "wonderful"
school = "Lambda School"
print(school + " is " + superlative)

>>> output: Lambda School is wonderful
```

- Notice how the argument for the `print` function can be an expression. Once the expression is resolved to a string object, the `print` function can output it to the screen.

Using `print` with other object types:

```
print(2020)
>>> output: 2020

print(123.456)
>>> output: 123.456

print(False)
>>> output: False

print(["Lambda", "School", 2, 0, 2, 0])
>>> output: ['Lambda', 'School', 2, 0, 2, 0]

print(("Lambda", "School"))
>>> output: ('Lambda', 'School')

print({"school": "Lambda School", "year": 2020})
>>> output: {'school': 'Lambda School', 'year': 2020}
```

- Any object passed as an argument into `print` will get converted into a string type before outputted to the screen.

- You can see how the `print` function is easy to use and how it can handle any object type that you pass into it.

##### Passing multiple arguments into `print`
Now, let's look at how we can pass multiple arguments into the `print` function. Using `print` with multiple arguments gives you a flexible and easy way to output items to the screen.

We can pass multiple objects, all the same or different types, into `print`.

```
print("Lambda School", 2020, True)
>>> output: Lambda School 2020 True
```

- Notice how each object we passed in was converted to a string and then output to the screen. Notice also that `print` used `" "` as the default separator value.

We can change the separator value by assigning a value to the keyword argument `sep`.
```
print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="!!!")
>>> Output:
    Lambda School!!!2020!!!True

print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="\t")
>>> output:
    Lambda School   2020    True

print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="\n")
>>> output:
    Lambda School
    2020
    True

print("Lambda School", 2020, True, sep="")
>>> output:
    Lambda School2020True
```

##### Specifying the `end` value with `print`
You can also specify the `end` value by assigning a value to the `end` keyword argument when you call the `print` function. Being able to print a value to the screen but allow the user to stay on the same line is useful and necessary in some cases.

Here is how you can change the default `end` value (which is `\n`) when calling the `print` function.
```
print("Are you a Lambda School student?", end=" (Y or N)")
>>> output: 
    Are you a Lambda School student? (Y or N)>>>
```

- Customizing the `end` value when calling the `print` function can be useful and necessary in some circumstances.

You have now learned the basics of using the `print` function in Python. You learned how to call the `print` function to print objects of different types. You now know how to use `print` with multiple positional arguments. In certain necessary situations, you also know how to change the default `end` value when calling the `print` function.

Now, get some practice using the `print` function by completing the challenge below.

#### Challenge

Use white space to denote blocks

#### Overview
Python is unique because indentation instead of some other character marks blocks of code. A block of code is a collection of statements that are grouped. The syntax for denoting blocks varies from language to language. For example, in C, blocks are delimited by curly braces (`{` and `}`). Understanding how Python uses whitespace and indentation to denote logical lines and code blocks is essential.

#### Follow Along
##### Whitespace Characters
Whitespace is any character represented by something that appears empty (usually `\t` or `" "`). The characters that Python considers to be whitespace can be seen by printing out the value of `string.whitespace` from the `string` library.

```
import string
string.whitespace
>>> output: 
    ' \t\n\r\x0b\x0c'
```

- Notice the characters are `" "` (space), `\t` (tab), `\n` (newline), `\r` (return), `\x0b` (unicode line tabulation), and `\x0c` (unicode form feed).

You've seen the different types of whitespace characters that can appear, but you mainly need to concern yourself with `" "`, `\t`, and `\n`.

##### Logical Lines of Code
Whitespace is used to denote the end of a logical line of code. In Python, a logical line of code's end (a statement, or a definition) is marked by a `\n`.

```
first = "Lambda"
second = "School"
first + second
>>> output:
    'LambdaSchool'
    
first \
+ \
second
>>> output:
    'LambdaSchool'
```

- Notice how the REPL evaluates the expression `first + second` when I return on line 3. Below that, I can write one logical line of code over multiple lines by ending each line with a `\ ` character. That `\ ` character lets the Python interpreter know that even though there is a newline, you don't want it to treat it as the end of a logical line.

It's important to understand that Python assumes meaning in newline characters when trying to interpret your code.

##### Code Blocks
Whitespace (indentation) can denote code blocks. Python gives meaning to the amount of whitespace (indentation level) that comes before a logical line of code.

```
if True:
if True:
>>> output:
    File "<stdin>", line 2
    if True:
    ^
    IndentationError: expected an indented block
```

- This code raises an `Indentation Error` because the Python interpreter expects to find additional whitespace inside the `if` block.

```
if True:
    if True:
        print("it worked!")
>>> output:
    it worked!
```

- The Python interpreter can successfully run this code because consistent whitespace (level of indentation) is used.

```
if True:
    if True:
        print("it worked!")
>>> output:
    File "<stdin>", line 3
        print("it worked!")
                          ^
    TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation
```

- Although you can't tell in the code snippet above, for the second `if` statement, I used a `\t` to indent. But, for the indentation on `print("it worked!")`, I used eight `" "` (spaces). The mismatch of tab usage and spaces raises an error when Python tries to interpret the code.

Consistent whitespace usage (indentation) is crucial to making sure that Python can interpret your code correctly.

In Python, whitespace has meaning; it denotes the end of logical lines and also code blocks. Whitespace is any character represented by something that appears empty, although the most common characters are `" "`, `\t`, and `\n`. The Python interpreter knows where the end of a logical line of code is because of the `\n`. The amount of whitespace (level of indentation) is used in Python to denote blocks of code. Understanding how the Python interpreter looks at whitespace is vital to writing valid Python code.

#### Challenge

```
"""
1. Import the `string` module, and then print out the 
    value at `string.whitespace`.
"""

import string
print(string.whitespace)
>>> output:
    
    
    
    

"""
2. Write an expression that adds the values of the 
    three variables (`a`, `b`, and `c`) below and 
    assign it to `result`. However, you cannot do it 
    on one line of code. You need to write the 
    expression on five lines of code
"""
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
result = a \
+ \
b \

c

# This should print 6
print(result)
>>> output:

"""
3. Fix the code below so that `it worked!` prints 
    to the console.
"""
if True:
    if True:
        if True:
            print("it worked!")
>>> output:
    it worked!
```

#### Overview
Python is not a "statically typed" language, and every variable in Python is an object. You don't have to declare a variable's type.

#### Follow Along
##### Numbers
In Python, you can have integers and floating-point numbers.

You can define an integer like so:

```
my_int = 3
```

You can also cast a floating-point number to be an integer like so:

```
my_int = int(3.0)
```

To define a floating-point number, you can declare it literally or typecast it with the float constructor function:

```
my_float = 3.0
my_float = float(3)
```

##### Strings
You can define strings with either single or double quotes:

```
my_string = 'Lambda School'
my_string = "Lambda School"
```

It's common to use double quotes for strings so that you can include apostrophes without accidentally terminating the string.

```
my_string = "I don't have to worry about apostrophes with my double-quotes."
```

Let's practice declaring variables to store an int, a float, and a string:

```
my_int = 2
my_float = 5.0
my_str = "Lambda School"
```

#### Challenge

```
"""
Modify the assignment statements below so that an integer 
    is assigned to "my_int", a floating point is assigned 
    to "my_float", and a string is assigned to "my_string".

Then, use typecasting to print your integer as a floating 
    point number. Use typecasting again to print your 
    floating point number as an integer.
"""

# Modify the code below to fulfill the requirements 
    outlined in the docstring.
my_int = 3
my_float = 6.3
my_string = 'This is fun!'

# Practice typecasting as outlined above with these print 
    statements.
print(float(my_int))
print(int(my_float))

>>> output:
    3.0
    6
```
