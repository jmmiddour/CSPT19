### Overview
A module is a collection of code that is written to meet specific needs. For example, you could split up different parts of a game you were building into modules. Each module would be a separate Python file that you could manage separately.

### Follow Along
Any Python file that ends with the `.py` extension is considered a `module`. The name of the module is the name of the file.

To import from other modules, we can use the `import` command.

```
import math

print(math.factorial(5))
output ---> 120
```

So, by importing the built-in `math` module, we have access to all of the functions and data defined in that module. We access those functions and data using `dot notation`, just like we do with objects.

If you only need a specific function from a module, you can `import` that specific function like so:

```
from math import factorial

print(factorial(5))
output ---> 120
```

You can also `import` all the names from a module with this syntax to avoid using `dot notation` throughout your file.

```
from math import *

print(factorial(5))
output ---> 120

print(pow(2, 3))
output ---> 8.0
```

You can also bind the module to a name of your choice by using `as`.

```
import math as alias

print(alias.factorial(5))
output ---> 120
```

To find out which names a module defines when imported, you can use the `dir()` method. This method returns an `alphabetically sorted` list of strings for all of the `names defined in the module`.

```
import math

print(dir(math))
# ['__doc__', '__file__', '__loader__', '__name__',
   '__package__', '__spec__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 
   'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil', 'comb', 
   'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'dist', 'e', 
   'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1', 'fabs', 'factorial', 
   'floor', 'fmod', 'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma', 'gcd', 
   'hypot', 'inf', 'isclose', 'isfinite', 'isinf', 
   'isnan', 'isqrt', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 
   'log1p', 'log2', 'modf', 'nan', 'perm', 'pi', 'pow', 
   'prod', 'radians', 'remainder', 'sin', 'sinh', 
   'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'tau', 'trunc']
```

### Challenge
```
"""
Import the "math" module. Then, print an alphabetically 
    sorted list of all the functions available 
    in the "math" module that start with the 
    letters "is".
"""

import math

for val in dir(math):
  if val.startswith('is'):
    print(val)

OUTPUT:
isclose
isfinite
isinf
isnan
isgrt
```

### Overview
Lists are similar to arrays. They can store any type of variable and as many variables as you want. You can iterate over lists effortlessly.

To build a list, you can do the following:

```
my_list = [] # empty list literal
my_list.append(1) # add 1 to end of list
my_list.append(2) # add 2 to end of list
my_list.append(3) # add 3 to end of list
print(my_list[0]) # prints 1
print(my_list[1]) # prints 2
print(my_list[2]) # prints 3

# iterate over the list with for statement to print each item in my_list
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

In Python, if you try to access a list index that does not exist, you get an `IndexError: list index out of range` message:

```
my_list = [1,2,3]
print(my_list[10])

OUTPUT:
    IndexError: list index out of range
```

### Follow Along
Let's make sure we can perform basic list operations.

First, let's create a `numbers` list that contains the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3`.

```
numbers = []
numbers.append(1)
numbers.append(2)
numbers.append(3)
```

Now, let's create a `strings` list that contains the strings `"Lambda"` and `"School"`:

```
strings = []
strings.append("Lambda")
strings.append("School")
```

Now, let's make sure we can access items from a specific index in a list. Let's access the `3rd item` from `numbers` and the `2nd item` from `strings` and `print` them out (don't forget that `lists are zero-indexed`).

```
print(numbers[2], strings[1])
```

Last, let's iterate through our `numbers` list to `sum up all the numbers`:

```
sum = 0
for number in numbers:
    sum += number
```

### Challenge
```
"""
1. Create a "numbers" list that contains two different integer values and two different floating point values.

2. Create a "strings" list that contains three different strings.

3. Print the 4th number of your numbers list and the 1st string of your strings list.

4. Iterate through your strings list and print each string.
"""

numbers = [3, 6.3, 9, 12.3]
strings = ['Happy', 'Go', 'Lucky']

print(numbers[3])
print(strings[0])

OUTPUT:
    12.3
    Happy
```

### Overview
A Python `object` encapsulates `variables` (`data`) and `functions` (`behavior`) into a `single entity`. An object instance gets its variables and functions from the class that was used to instantiate it. Think of a class as a blueprint or template that you can use to create objects.

### Follow Along
Let's define a class, so we can use it as a blueprint for an object.

```
class MyFirstClass:
    variable = "data"

    def function(self):
        return "Printing from a MyFirstClass object."
```

Now, to create an object based on `MyFirstClass`, we call the class like a function and assign the instance object to a variable.

```
a_class_object = MyFirstClass()
```

Now we can use `dot notation` to access variables and functions on the object.

```
print(a_class_object.variable)
output ---> data

print(a_class_object.function())
output ---> Printing from a MyFirstClass object.
```

In general, a `dot expression` is written as `<expression>.<name>`. The `<expression>` must evaluate to an `object`, and the `name` must be an `attribute on that object`.

The whole point of defining a class is so that you can use the same template to create multiple objects. All of the objects you make by instantiating the class will have the attributes that were a part of the class definition.

```
another_class_object = MyFirstClass()

print(another_class_object.variable)
output ---> data

print(another_class_object.function())
output ---> Printing from a MyFirstClass object.
```

Notice that both `a_class_object` and `another_class_object` have access to the defined attributes in the class.

### Challenge
```
"""
Below, you'll find a class definition for animals. Create two new animals `cat`
and `dog`. Set `cat` to have a name of "Purrfect", kind of "cat",
and color of "brown". Set `dog` to have a name of "Fido",
kind of "dog", and color of "black".
"""
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name="", kind="", color=""):
        self.name = name
        self.kind = kind
        self.color = color
    
    def description(self):
        return "%s is a %s %s." % (self.name, self.color, self.kind)

# Create instances of Animal here and modify the instance attributes
# as described above.

cat = Animal(name="Purrfect", kind="cat", color="brown")
dog = Animal(name="Fido", kind="dog", color="black")

# Should print Purrfect is a brown cat.
print(cat.description())
# Should print Fido is a black dog.
print(dog.description())
```
